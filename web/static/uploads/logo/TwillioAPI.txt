# Hosted Number Orders - API Quickstart

> \[!WARNING]
>
> This API is currently in Developer Preview

The [Twilio Hosted Numbers API](/docs/phone-numbers/hosted-numbers/hosted-numbers-api/hosted-number-order-resource) allows you to use Twilio's Programmable SMS with your existing US and Canada voice landline and toll-free numbers. The voice traffic will remain with the current voice provider, while Twilio's SMS routing profile will be applied for inbound and outbound SMS traffic on Twilio.

The Hosted Number Orders API provides a way to SMS enable a number and host on Twilio without having to purchase or port a number to Twilio. The API enables the ability to host a number using a structured API that provides a low-touch and secure workflow for you and your customers.

The Hosted Number Orders API is in Developer Preview and works for US & Canada landline and toll-free numbers that are *not* currently enabled for messaging. Hosted Numbers costs $0.50 a month. [Request early access to the Hosted Numbers SMS Enablement developer preview](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging/channels/sms) to get your account access.

Create new Hosted Number Order

```bash

## **Quick Start Tutorial**

The Hosted Number Orders API allows you to: submit an SMS enablement request, get immediate hosting eligibility validation of the number, track Hosted Number Order status transitions, and automate configuring a Hosted Number before the number is active on Twilio's Super Network.

Suppose you wanted to SMS enable your number *+18444905863* and host on Twilio. Your first step would be to create a new Hosted Number Order with the phone number in [+E.164 format](/docs/glossary/what-e164).

Twilio will check if the number meets the criteria for SMS enablement and, if valid, will create the Hosted Number Order and return a JSON resource of the instance resource:

Verify Ownership with Phone Call

```bash
curl -XPOST https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/HostedNumberOrders/HR36f3f0c7c8d5d9210114fdcd8b6bcf19 \
  -u 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:your_auth_token' \
  -d "VerificationType=phone-call" \
  -d "Status=pending-verification"
```

```json
{
    "status": "pending-verification",
    "date_updated": "2018-01-21T22:31:43Z",
    "verification_code": "310001",
    "incoming_phone_number_sid": "PN876a18805574a952ffb73907b24205f0",
    "failure_reason": "",
    "verification_attempts": 1,
    "verification_type": "phone-call",
    "capabilities": {
        "voice": false,
        "mms": false,
        "sms": true
    },
    "sid": "HR36f3f0c7c8d5d9210114fdcd8b6bcf19",
    "phone_number": "+18444905863",
    "call_delay": 0,
    "signing_document_sid": null,
    "verification_document_sid": "RI2ad9942e6daa7d8e87a154f6f675f3f8",
    "verification_call_sids": [
        "CA83f7aa47a1760188e892fe8c2ba86749"
    ],
    "extension": null,
    "url": "https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/HostedNumberOrders/HR36f3f0c7c8d5d9210114fdcd8b6bcf19",
    "friendly_name": "My_Sms_Hosted_Number_Order",
    "account_sid": "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "date_created": "2018-01-21T21:40:55Z"
}
```

## Ownership Verification

Once a number has passed the pre-validation check and is moved to the *received* status, the next phase will be to move the number to *pending-verification* where Twilio will call the number and ask for a security token. The phone call will prompt for the token four times before the call hangs up, and up to three verifications can be performed before the number moves to *action-required*, when a Twilio admin must be involved. If in `action-required` for more than 7 days, the Hosted Number Order will be marked as `failed` and a new Hosted Number Order will need to be created to go through the process again.

Twilio must verify that the end-user answering the phone call is the one requesting the text provisioning on the phone number. This verification step ensures that all requests are from legitimate end-users to ensure the authenticity of ownership.

To navigate past [IVRs](/docs/glossary/what-is-ivr), you can include an Extension parameter along with a `w`. Each `w` character tells Twilio to wait 0.5 seconds instead of playing a digit. This lets you adjust the timing of when the digits begin playing to suit the phone system you are dialing.

For example, the extension "wwww2wwwwww5wwwwww9″ waits two seconds before sending the digit 2, followed by a three-second wait before sending the 5, and finally another three-second wait before sending a 9. You will need to tune the extension to the IVR system to be able to programmatically verify numbers behind IVR menus.

Create new Authorization Document

```bash
$ curl -X POST https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/AuthorizationDocuments \
    -u 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:your_auth_token' \
    -d "HostedNumberOrderSids=HR7e42fbbfb47d17baaae45d94c34ec4c3" \
    -d "HostedNumberOrderSids=HR18b3fc4bb26c368ceff1587ec26bf892" \
    -d "HostedNumberOrderSids=HR842cc9ce52ce257da378c2972f88fecc" \
    -d "HostedNumberOrderSids=HRc401d83d7d66901d2b65a4700457272d" \
    -d "AddressSid=AD1e20d20a7772e157c8ddbaba36aefef0" \
    -d "Email=owner@example.com" \
    -d "CcEmails=person1@example.com&CcEmails=person2@example.com"
```

```json
{
    "status": "signing",
    "date_updated": "2017-10-16T23:54:59Z",
    "cc_emails": [
        "person1@example.com",
        "person2@example.com"
    ],
    "url": "https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/AuthorizationDocuments/PX5b7889b420ec6bca465c068f5bc2b67e",
    "address_sid": "AD1e20d20a7772e157c8ddbaba36aefef0",
    "sid": "PX5b7889b420ec6bca465c068f5bc2b67e",
    "date_created": "2017-10-16T23:54:58Z",
    "email": "owner@example.com"
}
```

## Create new LOA and Sign

Carriers require a signed Letter of Authorization (LOA) by the authorized end user of the phone number to enable SMS capabilities. Twilio will generate this document with the address information and phone numbers you passed, to be sent for your or your customer's review and signature. To trigger the LOA email, issue a `POST` request to the Hosted Numbers Authorization Documents list resource with the required information. The new Authorization Document will be moved to `signing`, along with the Hosted Number Orders attached to the Authorization Document moving to `pending-loa`.

A Document SID is provided to you in the response. By performing a `GET` on the HostedNumberOrders endpoint, you can keep up-to-date status to track the Hosted Number Order during the signature process with the Hosted Number Order SID.

Update the Phone Number Configuration

```bash
$ curl -XPOST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/IncomingPhoneNumbers/PN9c45b3eb69d07536c60a621891420bfc.json \
-d "SmsUrl=https://demo.twilio.com/welcome/sms/reply/" \
-d "FriendlyName=something new"
-u 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:your_auth_token'
```

```json
{
    "sid": "PN9c45b3eb69d07536c60a621891420bfc",
    "account_sid": "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",

    },
    "voice_receive_mode": "voice",
    "status_callback": null,
    "status_callback_method": null,
    "api_version": "2010-04-01",
    "voice_application_sid": null,
    "sms_application_sid": null,
    "origin": "hosted",

}
```

## Configure Hosted Number

You don't have to wait for the Hosted Number Order to complete in order to configure your number with an incoming SMS webhook. The [Incoming Phone Numbers API](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource) provides a programmatic way to pre-configure the number with the Incoming Phone Number SID.

```bash title="Release a hosted number from your active numbers"
$ curl -DELETE https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/IncomingPhoneNumbers/PN9c45b3eb69d07536c60a621891420bfc.json \
-u 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:your_auth_token'
```

## Remove Hosted Number from your inventory and remove Twilio's SMS Routing Profile

When you no longer want to host your phone number for SMS on Twilio, you can send a `DELETE` request to the phone number instance on the Incoming Phone Numbers resource. The Hosted Number takes 3 days before fully retiring from our system. If you accidentally released your Hosted Number, please write to [hostedsms@twilio.com](mailto:hostedsms@twilio.com) to request restoration. After 3 days, Twilio will unregister the number for SMS, and the number will turn into a landline or Toll-Free with no SMS routing.

# Best Practices for Phone Number Use

## Overview

Global telecommunications regulations vary from country to country and are always changing. Twilio builds software, like [Messaging Service Features](/docs/messaging/services) and Message Queues, to help with the complexity. It lets you send calls and texts without being a telecoms expert. But, if you keep inactive phone numbers Twilio may reclaim them to follow regulations.

This guide will walk you through best practices for active phone number traffic. This way you'll know when to keep a number, and when to release it. You'll also learn what you can do to stop your numbers from getting reclaimed due to lack of use.

  * [Re-use numbers when possible](#re-use-numbers-when-possible)
  * [Send traffic on inactive numbers](#send-traffic-on-inactive-numbers)

## What's a reclaimed number?

On occasion, Twilio will take back inactive phone numbers to comply with local telecom regulations. If you want to hang on to certain numbers, the steps in the guide will help you keep them in active use.

You can find more details on when Twilio reclaims phone numbers in our [Terms of Service](/en-us/legal/tos#restrictions).

## What counts as active use on a phone number?

There aren't hard and fast rules that work the same way everywhere in the world. But, we can offer some general definitions that cover most use cases.

For the most part, an active number:

* Made or received at least 3 phone calls with a duration of 12 seconds or longer and a ["completed" status](/docs/voice/api/call-resource) in the last month.

OR

* Sent or received 3 text messages in the last month.

## Active Phone Number Best Practices

### Upgrade your account

We reclaim phone numbers in trial and suspended accounts before phone numbers that belong to paid accounts. By [upgrading your account](https://www.twilio.com/console/billing) and keeping it in good standing, you'll be less likely to have your number(s) reclaimed.

### Buy numbers you will use

When estimating how many numbers you need, be sure to buy numbers that you can use in the short term. Keep your inventory close to the amount of numbers that you plan to activate within the next month or two.

There's usually not a need for you to carry a large inventory of phone numbers. You can always get more numbers when you need them with the [available numbers API](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumber-resource). Each phone number you buy has a recurring monthly cost. So, you'll save money by keeping your inventory small.

### Know which of your numbers are active

You can use the [/Messages](/docs/messaging/api/message-resource) and [/Calls](/docs/voice/api/call-resource) API to see the activity on each of your numbers. Check you numbers once a month to see if you have inactive numbers.

### Release numbers you don't use

Releasing a number removes it from your account. When you check your usage each month, release inactive numbers. You can do so by [using the Console or via API](https://help.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223183028-Cancel-or-release-a-Twilio-number). There's no charge to release a number and you can [restore](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/restore) it within 10 days if you change your mind.

### Rotate messages across a pool of numbers using Messaging Services

A Twilio Messaging Service allows you to "pool" multiple numbers together. When you send SMS from that service, the Messaging Service use each number from the pool in turn. Each number gets even use. You can keep your numbers active without the need to build your own application logic.

### Reclaim numbers from your customers

If your customers get phone numbers from you, consider taking back unused numbers. You can then give those numbers to other customers or release them back to Twilio. This is easier to do if you use [subaccounts](/docs/iam/api/subaccounts) for multitenancy.

### Re-use numbers when possible

If you cycle through numbers in short succession, it's best to re-use numbers in your own inventory. Fraud accounts will release numbers and buy new ones right away over and over again. When we see this pattern, we may suspend the account, in accordance with [your agreement with Twilio](/en-us/legal/tos#restrictions), to investigate potential fraud. To keep your account active, re-use numbers when possible.

### Send traffic on inactive numbers

If you'd like to keep your numbers instead of releasing them, you can run a script to keep them active. Send a few text messages or phone calls each month to keep your numbers active. This will help to ensure they don't get reclaimed.

Title: Configure your default Sender ID
Source: md
Fetched (UTC): 2026-01-23 21:14:27Z
============================================================================================

# Configure your default Sender ID

In this guide, you'll learn what a default Sender ID is, how it works, when to use it, and how to change it.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> Twilio introduced default Sender IDs for destinations that require Sender ID registration on July 10, 2024. If you had only one Sender ID registered in a country at that time, Twilio set it as the default. Twilio doesn't set Sender IDs registered afterward as default. You can set or change the default Sender ID at any time.

## What is a default Sender ID?

You can set a default Sender ID for any country where you've registered one or more Sender IDs. It's usually an Alphanumeric Sender ID, but it can be a short code or long code phone number.

If you have a default Sender ID and the `From` value in your API request doesn't match any of your registered Sender IDs, Twilio replaces it. Twilio uses the default Sender ID instead when sending the message.

A default Sender ID guarantees that all your messages sent to a specific destination comply with local regulations when Sender ID registration is required. This prevents carriers from dropping or blocking messages if you accidentally use a long code or other non-compliant Sender ID as the From value of your API request.

If you don't have a default Sender ID or you remove it, Twilio tries to send your messages using the `From` value you provide. If this value doesn't comply with SMS guidelines, carriers could block your messages or they could fail to deliver.

### Example scenario

Let's say you registered two Alphanumeric Sender IDs in both Colombia and Mexico: "Owl Inc" and "Hoot Hoot." In this example, "Hoot Hoot" is set as the default Sender ID for Colombia, but there's no Default Sender ID in Mexico.

**When sending messages to Colombia**:

* **From: "Owl Inc"**—Message sent with "Owl Inc" (registered Sender ID)
* **From: "Hoot Hoot"**—Message sent with "Hoot Hoot" (registered Sender ID)
* **From: "+15551234567"**—Message sent with "Hoot Hoot" (Default Sender ID)
* **From: "Other Corp"**—Message sent with "Hoot Hoot" (Default Sender ID)

**When sending messages to Mexico**:

* **From: "Owl Inc"**—Message sent with "Owl Inc" (registered Sender ID)
* **From: "Hoot Hoot"**—Message sent with "Hoot Hoot" (registered Sender ID)
* **From: "+15551234567"**—Message sent with "+15551234567" (no Default Sender ID)
* **From: "Other Corp"**—Message sent with "Other Corp" (no Default Sender ID)

### Is the check for registered Sender IDs case sensitive?

Yes. In the scenario above, if your From parameter was "hoot hoot", it would not match the registered Sender ID "Hoot Hoot." In Colombia, Twilio uses the Default Sender "Hoot Hoot" to send the message. In Mexico, Twilio uses the original "hoot hoot" to send the message.

### Can you have more than one default Sender ID in a single country?

No, you can only have one default Sender ID per country. If you need to use two different Sender IDs in a single country, remove the default Sender ID. Then provide the appropriate Sender ID in the From value of your API request.

## Check your default Sender ID

To check if you have configured a default Sender ID in a specific country:

1. In the Twilio Console, go to **Phone numbers** > **Alphanumeric Sender IDs**.
2. Check the list of registered Sender IDs in the **Sender ID list** tab.
3. If a sender is set as default, you will see a **Default Sender ID** badge under the sender name and a blue tick beside the country where that sender is set as default.

If a sender is not set as default anywhere, there will be no badge under that sender.

## Change the default Sender ID for a country

To change the default Sender ID for a country:

1. In the Twilio Console, go to **Phone numbers** > **Alphanumeric Sender IDs**.
2. In the **Sender ID list** tab, expand the **Default Sender ID settings** section.

3) Click **Configure default Sender ID**.
4) In the modal, use the dropdown menus to select which countries you want each Sender ID to be the default.
5) Click **Save**.

## Remove the default Sender ID for a specific country

To remove the default Sender ID for a country:

1. In the Twilio Console, go to **Phone numbers** > **Alphanumeric Sender IDs**.
2. In the **Sender ID list** tab, expand the **Default Sender ID settings** section.

3) Click **Configure default Sender ID**.
4) In the modal, click the **X** next to the country name associated with the corresponding Sender ID.
5) Click **Save** for the changes to take effect.

> \[!WARNING]
>
> If you remove the Default Sender ID, make sure the From value you use for future messages to that destination follows SMS Guidelines and matches one of your registered Sender IDs for that country. Otherwise, your messages might be filtered or blocked.

# Global Phone Numbers Catalog

In the past nine years, we've worked with carriers around the globe to bring the power of programmable communications to [phone numbers in over 100](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/phone-numbers) countries. Over time, testing millions of numbers across an ever-increasing array of Twilio use cases, we learned what features our customers needed, and always striven to offer only numbers that met the broadest set of requirements. However, today, as our customers continue to innovate with new use cases, we believe the best product we can offer is not only one that satisfies all requirements but, more importantly, one that offers the best choices for the unique needs of every customer. We like to call these use case tailored phone numbers and they're at the center of our new Twilio Global Phone Numbers Catalog.

With the Global Phone Number Catalog, you get instant access to the breadth and depth of the communication options that exist in the phone numbers market, such as one-way numbers ideal for outbound use cases, or dual-function landline numbers for customer support messaging use cases. Starting today, you can search our full inventory through a new Phone Numbers API that provides:

* **A broader choice of phone numbers:** Access our full suite of available phone numbers, featuring numbers tailored to specific use cases, such as unidirectional or premium numbers.
* **More powerful search and management:** Get the right options for your specific application with use case-based search and granular attribute filters.
* **Rich phone number metadata:** See every number's detailed capabilities, geodata, regulatory requirements, and configuration, to help you effectively choose and manage your inventory.

The new API is independent of the existing `/AvailablePhoneNumbers` and `/IncomingPhoneNumbers` endpoints. You can continue using both, however some new number types will only be visible via the new API, due to their unique characteristics.

## REST API Reference Documents

[/AvailableNumbers](/docs/phone-numbers/global-catalog/api/available-numbers)

The new `/AvailableNumbers` resource lists all available numbers and is rich in number attributes that represent the capabilities of a phone number and how it interacts within Twilio's super network and programmable.

[/ActiveNumbers](/docs/phone-numbers/global-catalog/api/active-numbers)

The new `/ActiveNumbers` endpoint replaces the old `/IncomingPhoneNumbers` resource. This new resource provides the same rich metadata that `/AvailableNumbers` provides, and the same filterable functionality.

# Active Numbers Resource

> \[!WARNING]
>
> Active Numbers API is currently in closed private Developer Preview. Please use the generally available [Incoming Phone Numbers API](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource) if you do not have access.

The Global Phone Numbers Catalog - Active Numbers resource has the same search and filtering functions as Available Numbers. You can filter based on the attributes of a phone number and see detailed attributes of your current inventory. Some `PhoneNumber` instances may be null due to missing data. We are working towards a 100% inventory backed resource.

#### Example: Transfer number to subaccount

You can transfer phone numbers between two Twilio accounts if you're using [subaccounts](/docs/iam/api/subaccounts). For details, see [Exchanging Numbers Between Subaccounts](/docs/iam/api/subaccounts#exchanging-numbers).

### HTTP DELETE \[#instance-delete]

Release this phone number from your account. Twilio will no longer answer calls
to this number, and you will stop being billed the monthly phone number fee.
The phone number will eventually be recycled and potentially given to another
customer, so use with care. If you make a mistake, contact us. We may be able
to give you the number back.

If successful, returns an HTTP 204 response with no body.

#### Example: List all Active Numbers

You can manage your numbers by creating a list of all numbers that meet your search criteria filters.

### HTTP POST \[#list-post]

Purchases a new phone number for your account. If a phone number is found for
your request, Twilio will add it to your account and bill you for the first
month's cost of the phone number. If Twilio cannot find a phone number to match
your request, you will receive an HTTP 400 with [Twilio error code 21452][15].

If the number you are trying to purchase requires an identity document on file and you don't have a verified identity document associated with your account, you will receive an HTTP 400 with [Twilio error code 21650][16]. See [this support article][17] for more details.

To find an available phone number to `POST`, use the [AvailableNumbers](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumber-resource) list resource.

# REST API: Available Numbers

> \[!WARNING]
>
> Available Numbers API is currently in closed private Developer Preview.
> Use the generally available [Available Phone Numbers
> API](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumber-resource) if you don't have
> access.

The Available Numbers endpoint provides a rich view into Twilio's inventory of phone numbers available for purchase. As we've worked with operators across the globe to offer numbers that cover over 100 countries, we've learned that not all numbers are created equal. Phone numbers differ broadly in characteristics and regulatory requirements. Through the `/AvailableNumbers` endpoint, every number is described by a set of attributes, grouped in four categories: capabilities (voice, sms, mms), geography, regulatory requirements, and pricing. With granular search filters to select numbers with the right attributes for your application, you can narrow down search results to find the perfect number for your use case.

For number pricing and availability please refer to the [Support Number Catalog][number-catalog-twilio-support].

You can also search for numbers based on what you're building. To do this, pass your use case as a search parameter and we'll return numbers that have the right characteristics for your application.

Once you've found an available number you want to purchase, make an HTTP `POST` request to the `/ActiveNumbers` list resource passing the number as the `PhoneNumber` parameter.

## AvailableNumbers Instance Resource \[#available-numbers-instance]

### Resource URI \[#available-instance-uri]

You can make a request directly to `AvailableNumbers` instance resource and choose from any of the numbers that appear in the search as a result of the filters you've specified.

```bash
https://preview.twilio.com/AvailableNumbers

```

#### Saved Search \[#saved-search]

Saved Search allows you to search for numbers that meet your application's or project's specific criteria. Twilio has pre-defined 7 distinct use case saved search macros for you. The capability (`Voice` or `Sms`) *must* be included, and to have both voice and sms, you can specify multiple Saved Search filters. To see the exact filters being used for the 7 default use case saved search macros, please refer to the [Global Phone Numbers Catalog FAQ][saved-search-faq].

## What is Twilio Announcing? \[#announcement]

Twilio is announcing the Global Phone Numbers Catalog - a broader choice of phone numbers, available through the most powerful APIs in the industry. As we've grown our global coverage to offer phone numbers in over 100 countries, we've learned that numbers are not all created equal. In the past, we offered only numbers that could satisfy the broadest set of Twilio use cases. Today, with the Global Phone Numbers Catalog, we aim to offer not only the most feature-rich numbers but also those that best match the different needs of customers. We like to call these use case tailored phone numbers.

## Where are the Docs? \[#docs]

There are two new API endpoints being launched in conjunction with the Global Phone Number Catalog:

To search phone numbers available for purchase in the Catalog, use [preview.api.twilio.com/Numbers/AvailableNumbers][available-numbers].

To purchase, list, configure, and release phone numbers on a user account, use [preview.api.twilio.com/Numbers/ActiveNumbers][active-numbers].

## Is this functionality supported in Console? \[#console]

Not yet, we plan to launch Console support before going to Beta.

## Who is the typical customer for the Catalog and APIs? \[#customers]

All Twilio users can benefit from the broader selection of numbers and enhanced functionality of the new APIs. In particular, users that are not familiar with characteristics of phone numbers will benefit from the new use case based search functionality, to help them find numbers ideal for their use case. For example, a user looking for phone numbers for a contact center application, can pass the `SavedSearch=twilio.use-case.contact-centers.voice` to see numbers with characteristics suitable for that use case.

## What functionality are you launching and when? \[#launch-schedule]

The first release will be delivered in three phases:

*Developer Preview:* Support for new APIs that will allow search, purchase, list, configure, and release of numbers with support for attribute-based search functions, including use case based search. Catalog will include all the existing inventory of numbers available, plus Developer Preview numbers and new limited capability numbers.

*Beta:* Console support, including ability to create and save custom searches.

*GA:* Fully-featured version 1.0. Broader selection of use case tailored numbers, offering more choice and pricing options.

## How do customers get access to the new API? \[#request-access]

The API is currently in Developer Preview and new accounts are not being given access to the private resources. For more information, please visit [Global Phone Numbers Catalog Twilio page][access-request-form].

## How is the Global Phone Numbers Catalog different from our current inventory? \[#difference]

The Catalog, searchable through the new APIs, will include all the inventory available through the existing APIs, plus: Developer Preview numbers, numbers previously held back due to their unique characteristics, and a limited group of premium numbers (high value, depleted prefixes: +1800, +1212, +44800).

## Will the existing API be deprecated? \[#deprecated]

No. The existing API endpoints (*/AvailablePhoneNumbers* and */IncomingPhoneNumbers*) will continue operating as they do today. However, only fully featured phone numbers will be visible through */AvailablePhoneNumbers* API.

The new Phone Numbers API will have full support for attributes and support a wider catalog of numbers. This new API will eventually support catalog search, number purchase, and porting/hosting order tracking.

## How do I search/purchase/manage numbers in the Global Phone Numbers Catalog? \[#how-to-use]

Through two new API endpoints. See the Docs *[/AvailableNumbers][available-numbers]* and *[/ActiveNumbers][active-numbers]*.

## What are Saved Searches? \[#saved-searches]

Saved Searches give users a quick way to find numbers with specific characteristics, both in the Catalog, or in their account inventory. Twilio provides a set of predefined saved searches for the most common Twilio use cases: call tracking, contact centers, conversations, marketing, notifications, pbx-collaborations, and verifications. In a future release, users will be able to customize these searches, or create new ones, and save them to their account for convenience.

## Are there changes to pricing of phone numbers? \[#pricing-changes]

Pricing of existing numbers in our inventory has not been affected. The new Phone Numbers API exposes a broader selection of numbers due to its ability to present numbers with differing capabilities. For some searches, this broader selection will result in multiple options available to users, likely at different price points. For example, a search for UK phone numbers for Marketing Alerts', might return both 2-way voice+sms mobile numbers and 1-way SMS-only numbers, at two different prices. Vanity numbers and numbers in depleted area codes are now also available and can be priced differently.

The Hosted Number Orders product allows an account to request for their phone numbers to be hosted on Twilio for SMS. Start the Hosted Number onboarding process by sending a `POST` to the list resource, which will create a new request to host a phone number, or move the Hosted Number Order along the onboarding process by updating the status of the Hosted Number Orders Instance Resource. Upon creation of a Hosted Number Order instance resource, a corresponding [IncomingPhoneNumbers](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource) instance resource will also be created. Currently, Twilio only has the ability to onboard landline or toll-free US & Canada numbers that are not currently SMS enabled.

After the number's ownership has been verified, the user will then need to create a new Authorization Document that is electronically signed, giving Twilio permission to route SMS to and from Twilio's network. To see how to interact with the Authorization Documents resource, please visit the [Public API reference](/docs/phone-numbers/hosted-numbers/hosted-numbers-api/authorization-document-resource).

Once the process is completed, users will be able to answer phone calls on their existing infrastructure and leverage the same number identity for two-way SMS on Twilio's platform.

| failed               | The Hosted Number Order failed because the number is currently SMS enabled or has been idle for more than 30 days. At this point, it is no longer possible to re-submit the request for the failed Hosted Number Order. However, a *new* Hosted Number Order can be created for the same phone number once SMS registration has been deactivated on the phone number or the previous Hosted Number Order has failed due to being idle. |

## HostedNumberOrders Status Callback \[#status-Callback]

When a Hosted Number Order changes status, Twilio will make an asynchronous HTTP request to the StatusCallback URL if you provided one in your API request. By capturing this request, you can determine when the Hosted Number Order changes status.

The Hosted Number Orders status callback request passes the parameters listed in the table below:

| Status               | Description                                            |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Status               | The new status of the Hosted Number Order              |
| HostedNumberOrderSid | The unique sid of the Hosted Number Order              |
| PhoneNumber          | The \[+E.164]\[e164] format of the Hosted Number Order |

## Create a HostedNumberOrder resource

`POST https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/HostedNumberOrders`

Creates a new Hosted Number Order for the specified capability. Currently, only SMS is a supported capability.

## Ownership Verification

Ownership Verification is a security measure to host the number with Twilio for SMS to ensure the authenticity of the request.

## Delete a HostedNumberOrder resource

`DELETE https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/HostedNumberOrders/{Sid}`

Cancels the Hosted Number Order, and consequently, deletes the corresponding Incoming Phone Number.

{" "}

> \[!WARNING]
>
> You can only issue the `DELETE` request when the HostedNumberOrder status is
> in `received`, `pending-verification`, `verified` or `pending-loa`. If the
> Hosted Number Order is `completed`, you can off-board the Twilio platform by
> issuing a `DELETE` request to the corresponding
> [IncomingPhoneNumbers](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource).
> If the Hosted Number Order is in a `failed` state due to either current SMS
> enablement or idle timeout, a *new* Hosted Number Order can be created. The
> Hosted Number Order will keep failing if SMS enablement is not removed from
> the number.

============================================================================================

# Authorization Document Resource

> \[!CAUTION]
>
> The Hosted Phone Numbers API is currently under development, and this
> documentation is for existing users. A new version will soon be released as a
> generally available (GA) product. Please be aware that the API path
> `https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/AuthorizationDocuments` will change
> with the GA release. You will be informed about the timeline and given time to
> update accordingly.

An **Authorization Document** is a resource representing a legally binding document between Twilio and a customer to Authorize Twilio to run messaging traffic on a given set of Phone Numbers.

Hosted Number Orders can be assigned to an Authorization Document detailing which Address a Hosted Number Order is activated with. Once the Authorization Document has been signed, the Hosted Number Orders will then be registered to Twilio for routing capability.

## Create an AuthorizationDocument resource

`POST https://preview.twilio.com/HostedNumbers/AuthorizationDocuments`

Create an Authorization Document for authorizing the hosting of phone numbers' capability on Twilio's platform.

The resource is explicit and all Hosted Number Orders added upon creation are the entire list of numbers that are assigned to the Authorization Document. Once the `POST` to create a new Authorization Document has been created, the LOA will immediately be sent out for signature.

Title: Eligibility Resource (Public Beta)
Source: md
Fetched (UTC): 2026-01-23 21:14:29Z
============================================================================================

# Eligibility Resource (Public Beta)

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Eligibility APIs are currently available as a Public Beta product and the information contained in this document is subject to change.
>
> Public Beta products are not covered by a Twilio SLA.

Twilio's Eligibility API allows you to determine if the non-Twilio phone numbers already in your possession can be hosted with Twilio. It's often possible to use your existing phone numbers with Twilio's Messaging Services without changing the voice provider by hosting the messaging capability of those numbers with Twilio.

Determining a number's eligibility is the first step of the hosting process. Using the API, you can check the eligibility of a number or group of numbers before starting the hosting process. If a number cannot be hosted by Twilio, the API will provide a reason and suggest potential next steps.

## Base URL

All URLs referenced in the API documentation have the following base:

`https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/HostedNumber/Eligibility`

The API is served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

## Authentication

To authenticate requests to the Twilio APIs, Twilio supports [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Use your *API key* as the username and your *API key secret* as the password. You can create an API key either [in the Twilio Console](/docs/iam/api-keys/keys-in-console) or [using the API](/docs/iam/api-keys/key-resource-v1).

**Note**: Twilio recommends using API keys for authentication in production apps. For local testing, you can use your Account SID as the username and your Auth token as the password. You can find your Account SID and Auth Token in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).

Learn more about [Twilio API authentication](/docs/usage/requests-to-twilio).

## Create a single eligibility check request

**Resource URL**: `https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/HostedNumber/Eligibility`

To check a **single** phone number's eligibility, make a `POST` request to this resource.

See the following code sample for a complete curl request. See the [request properties table](#request-properties) for all the properties available on this resource.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/HostedNumber/Eligibility' \
-u "Account_SID:Auth_Token" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "friendly_name": "My first eligibility check",
    "phone_numbers": [
        {"phone_number": "+13175787XXX", "hosting_account_sid": "AC264f0af1e323b9a38e513c433828dXXX"}
    ]
}'

```

### Request properties

The resource accepts an array of one object called `phone_numbers`. The object must contain a `phone_number` in [E.164 format](/docs/glossary/what-e164) to check for eligibility. A `phone_numbers` object may also contain a Twilio Account SID (`hosting_account_sid`) belonging to the Twilio Account where you want to host the phone number. If a SID is not provided, the account used to make the request will be used as the hosting Twilio Account. This resource also accepts an optional `friendly_name` property, which allows you to assign a human-readable reference to the eligibility request.

## Create a bulk eligibility check request

**Resource URL**: `https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/HostedNumber/Eligibility/Bulk`

To check a set of up to **1,000** phone numbers' eligibility, make a `POST` request to this resource. After the bulk eligibility check is created, the next step is to [get the results for the bulk request](#get-results-for-a-bulk-request).

See the following code sample for a complete curl request. See the [request properties table](#request-properties-1) for all the properties available on this resource.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/HostedNumber/Eligibility/Bulk' \
-u "Account_SID:Auth_Token" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "friendly_name": "My first eligibility check",
    "phone_numbers": [
        {
           "phone_number": "+13175787XXX",
           "hosting_account_sid": "AC264f0af1e323b9a38e513c433828dXXX"
        },
        {
           "phone_number": "+15017122XXX",
           "hosting_account_sid": "AC264f0af1e323b9a38e513c433828dXXX"
        },
        {
           "phone_number": "+18003482XXX"
        }
    ]
}'

```

### Request properties

The resource accepts an array of objects called `phone_numbers`. Each object must contain a `phone_number` in [E.164 format](/docs/glossary/what-e164) to check for eligibility. A `phone_numbers` object may also contain a Twilio Account SID (`hosting_account_sid`) belonging to the Twilio Account where you want to host the phone numbers.

# Hosted Numbers FAQ

> \[!CAUTION]
>
> The Hosted Phone Numbers API is currently in development and not intended for use by new customers. This documentation exists to support customers who are already using the API. A new version of this API will be released as a generally available (GA) product in the near future. New customers should wait for the Hosted Phone Numbers GA release.

## What is a Hosted Number?

A Hosted Number provides a method for customers to use Twilio's Programmable Messaging, Functions, and Studio products to send and receive messages on voice-enabled numbers they already own as part of an established voice application.

## Will my current voice line be affected?

No, Hosted Number does not affect your voice capabilities of the number. Hosted Number only registers the number for messaging to route in and out of Twilio's platform.

## What numbers can I host on Twilio for messaging?

Hosted Number supports US and Canada numbers. Mobile numbers are not supported. Numbers already owned by a Twilio account for voice services cannot be hosted on another Twilio account for messaging services.

## How can I host my number?

You can initiate the hosting of your number using the Twilio [Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/hosted) or programmatically with an [API](/docs/phone-numbers/hosted-numbers/hosted-numbers-api/hosted-number-order-resource). Twilio will require the end-user to complete ownership verification and LoA (Letter of Authorization) signature.

## How do I verify I own the number I want to host?

Twilio currently provides the ability to verify ownership of a number. It is a phone call that the end-user answers and passes back a security token to Twilio.

## What are the eligibility requirements to enable messaging on a number?

By submitting a phone number to the Hosted Numbers API or Console, the phone number will be evaluated for eligibility. Eligibility is determined by the number's country of origin and if the number is currently messaging enabled.

If you would like to check a number's eligibility before it is submitted, Twilio offers [Lookup](https://www.twilio.com/console/lookup), a tool to see information about the number. If a number is not of type `mobile`, then the number is eligible to be Hosted for SMS. For toll-free numbers, if type is `null`, generally, the number is eligible to be Hosted for messaging.

For example, here is a lookup for an eligible Canadian local number:

```json
{
  "caller_name": null,
  "country_code": "CA",
  "phone_number": "+19029052034",
  "national_format": "(902) 905-2034",
  "carrier": {
    "mobile_country_code": null,
    "mobile_network_code": null,
    "name": "Iristel Inc. - ON",
    "type": "landline",
    "error_code": null
  },
  "add_ons": null,
  "url": "https://lookups.twilio.com/v1/PhoneNumbers/+19029052034?Type=carrier"
}
```

And here is an example lookup for an ineligible Canadian number:

```json
{
  "caller_name": null,
  "country_code": "CA",
  "phone_number": "+19029052032",
  "national_format": "(902) 905-2032",
  "carrier": {
    "mobile_country_code": null,
    "mobile_network_code": null,
    "name": "Twilio - SMS-Sybase365/MMS-SVR",
    "type": "voip",
    "error_code": null
  },
  "add_ons": null,
  "url": "https://lookups.twilio.com/v1/PhoneNumbers/+19029052032?Type=carrier"
}


```

## What information does Twilio need?

Twilio requires the following information before you can host a number:

* The authorized user's first and last name, and business name, if applicable. An authorized user is an individual who is a decision maker for the phone number.
* The corresponding service address associated with the phone number. This must be a true physical address — PO boxes are not considered valid service addresses.
  * **Note** All phone numbers have an address associated with them. For example, Twilio owns a desk phone and that desk phone is associated to Twilio's 375 Beale St address.
* An email address will receive the Letter of Authorization (LoA) document to be signed electronically.
* Optional CC email addresses of the LoA's watchers to be issued when the LoA has been sent out for signature and when it has been signed.
* An LoA signed by the authorized user of the number(s). The LoA will need to be completed and signed electronically, and will be generated during the submission process.
  * **Note** 15,000 numbers can be included on one LoA.
  * **Note** The information and signature on your LoA must match the authorized user's name and service address provided by their current voice provider, and it must be signed in order for your submission to be processed.

## Why does Twilio need this information?

Twilio is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and only collects Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that is mandated by the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) SMS registrars. Twilio keeps PII information for 90 days, depending on the requirement timeframe set for by sections of GDPR.

## What are the processing phases required to host my number?

After you submit your Hosted Number request, the number goes through a three-stage onboarding process:

1. **Preliminary eligibility check** — Twilio verifies that the number is in a valid format, from an allowed country, and of a valid type.\
   If the number passes this check, Twilio creates a Hosted Number entry for it in your Twilio Console in the `twilio-processing` status.
2. **SMS eligibility check** — Twilio verifies that the number is not already messaging-enabled. A number that is already marked as `messaging-enabled` with its current provider cannot be used for Hosted SMS on Twilio. If the number is not currently `messaging-enabled`, the Hosted Number Order will move to the `received` status.
3. **Verify Ownership** — Once a number passes both eligibility checks, you will be able to browse to the number in your Hosted Numbers list in the Console and place a verification call to the number.
4. **Sign an electronic LoA** — After the number has been verified, you will need to create an electronic LoA that will be sent to the email address specified for signature.
5. **Enable Hosted SMS** — When the LoA is signed, the number's status will become `carrier-processing`: the carrier will register the number for SMS and then test it for inbound connectivity. Once the test passes, the number will be provisioned to your account.

## What are the steps from start to finish to host a number for SMS in NANP?

1. Create a new [Hosted Number](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/hosted) to begin the order process. At this point, the number is checked for eligibility. Once the Hosted Number has passed the eligibility check, the Hosted SMS will move into the `received` status.
   * If the eligibility check fails, your Hosted Number Order will fail with the reason in Console and in the API (i.e., already Hosted Number, non-supported country, Mobile type).
2. The next step is to verify proof of ownership of the Hosted number with a verification call.
   * Initiate the call by moving the status to `pending-verification` via the API, or initiating the call on the [Console's Hosted Number Order page](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/hosted/HR0e4efad858b7d57689c56c05697194b4).
3. Once your Hosted Number(s) have been verified, the Hosted Number will have to be electronically placed on a new Letter of Authorization (LoA).
   * The email specified on the LoA will receive an email from HelloSign to electronically sign the document. The document should be signed by the end-user answering the phone number.
   * **Note** If you have not already done so, create an [Address object](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/addresses) with the Friendly Name being the business, and the First and Last name that of the authorized end-user, the decision maker on behalf of the phone number.
4. After the LoA is signed, the Hosted Number orders assigned to the LoA will move into a `carrier-processing` status.
   * **Note** Landline numbers will take up to one business day, while Toll-Free numbers can take up to 2-3 business days.
5. Once the number has been successfully registered for messaging with Twilio, the number will move to the `testing` status for a short period, to ensure inbound messaging connectivity is functional.
6. When testing is successful, the Hosted Number Order will move to `completed` and your Hosted Number will move to `in-use`.
   * **Note** If you would like to receive status updates on the Hosted Number Order, you can configure a Status Callback URL.

## How long does it take to message enable my number?

If you are using a verification phone call, an NANP landline number can take up to one business day to SMS enable, test inbound connectivity, and provision to your account.

Toll-Free numbers can take up to three business days to update. If you are the RespOrg of the Toll-Free number, you are able to speed the request by accepting Twilio's request to messaging-enable the number. If you are not the RespOrg, please inform your service provider to prevent any denial of Twilio's text provisioning request.

## What happens if the number moves to action-required?

When a number moves into `action-required`, a failure reason is exposed in both the public API and in the Console to help you diagnose and resolve the issue. If the issue is internal to Twilio, a **Contact Hosted Numbers Support** panel will be displayed in the Console. If you are using the API, please send your Hosted Number Order SID to [HostedSMS@twilio.com](mailto:HostedSMS@twilio.com) for support.

Here are some typical failure reasons:

* The Letter of Authorization was not signed within seven days.
* The Hosted Number Order was idle in the verification process for seven days.
* The Hosted Number Order has reached the maximum number of verification attempts.
* Twilio cannot host the phone number because carrier information is unavailable.
* The number is already enabled for messaging by another provider.
* There was a problem processing your Hosted Number Order.

If you receive any of these, please contact [HostedSMS@twilio.com](mailto:HostedSMS@twilio.com).

## How can I bypass my call tree to receive the verification call?

You can verify numbers behind Interactive Voice Responses (IVRs) using both the above methods by including `w` characters in the `Extension` parameter. Each `w` tells Twilio to wait half a second instead of playing a digit. This lets you adjust when the digits begin playing to suit the phone system you are dialing.

For example, the `Extension` value `wwww2wwwwww5wwwwww9` waits two seconds before sending the digit 2, followed by a three-second wait before sending the 5, and finally another three-second wait before sending a 9. You will need to tune the extension to the IVR system to be able to programmatically verify numbers behind IVR menus.

## Product support for Hosted SMS

### Co-pilot/Messaging Service

Yes! Hosted SMS works with Co-Pilot/Messaging Service.

### Proxy

Unfortunately, Proxy does not currently work with Hosted SMS, but Twilio expects to add support in the future.

### Flex

Flex supports Hosted Number via [Flex Conversations](/docs/flex/conversations). Hosted Number is not available on [Flex Legacy Messaging](/docs/flex/developer/messaging).

## Can I use my Hosted Number as a Verified/Outgoing Caller-ID?

Yes, a Hosted Number is capable of making outbound calls over Twilio's network, as well as two-way messages.

If an account already has an active Verified Caller-ID and then the account requests to host the same number for messaging, the Verified Caller-ID will be deleted and the number will bypass the proof of ownership since the Verified Caller-ID is already validated ownership with a two-factor authentication call.

## What if I no longer want to host my number on Twilio?

If you have completed the Hosted Number Order process but no longer want to host a number on Twilio, you can disassociate the number from Twilio by sending a [`DELETE` request on the IncomingPhoneNumbers instance resource](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource#delete-an-incomingphonenumber-resource), or by removing the number from your account on the **Hosted Number** instance page in the Console's [Manage Active Numbers section](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming). The number will be in the released status for three days until the number is no longer registered to Twilio's network.

## What if I made a mistake on the Authorization Document?

Please [revoke](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/authorization-documents/hosted) the existing Authorization Document in the Console. Once the Authorization Document has been revoked, all of the Hosted Number Orders that have been mapped to the Authorization Document will move to the `verified` status. To send out a new Authorization Document, select all verified Hosted Number Orders and bulk action create in the Console's [Hosted Number Orders section](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/hosted) to generate a new one with the corrected information.

## Can I use MMS with Hosted Number?

US and Canadian local and toll-free can be hosted for SMS and MMS.

## Can I transfer my Hosted Number from my Parent Account to my Subaccounts?

A Hosted Number can be transferred using the [Subaccounts Public API](/docs/iam/api/subaccounts#exchanging-numbers). This functionality is not available in the Console.

## What if I want to fully port the number to have both Messaging and Voice capabilities?

You will need to generate a new port request. The new port request will **generate a new Phone Number SID** (`PNxxx`) as soon as a port is submitted. This means there will be two numbers with the same `phone_number` value, but different SIDs.

Ensure that you configure the new phone number right way with the appropriate SMS incoming URL to prevent downtime for your customers.

You can configure the number using the API or the Console. You can use the [Phone Number API](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource#code-filter-incomingphonenumbers-with-exact-match) and the E.164 format filter to find the new phone number's SID. After finding the SID of the porting number, use the [Phone Number API](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource#code-filter-incomingphonenumbers-with-exact-match) to configure the SMS and Voice URL.

Beta products don't have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Learn more about [beta product support](https://help.twilio.com/articles/115002413087-Twilio-Beta-product-support).

The Portability resource allows you to check if a number can be ported to Twilio before starting the porting process. This resource also provides details about why a number cannot be ported or if manual actions are needed to facilitate the porting of that number.

## PhoneNumber Properties

```

## Not portable reason codes

When Twilio can't port a phone number, the response body of the HTTP 400 (BAD REQUEST) includes one of the following portability reason codes within the `not_portable_reason` and `not_portable_reason_code` properties.

| Status code                     | Portability reason                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Check Portability

`GET https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/Porting/Portability/PhoneNumber/{PhoneNumber}`

To check the portability of a single phone number with the Portability resource, send a `GET` request.
Replace `{phone_number}` with your [E.164 formatted](/docs/glossary/what-e164) phone number and `{target_account_sid}` with the destination Account SID, if it differs from the account used to call the API.

The following example shows how to check portability using a curl command:

```bash
curl --location 'https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/Porting/Portability/PhoneNumber/{phone_number}?TargetAccountSid={target_account_sid}'
-u "Account_Sid:Access_token"
```

### Path parameters

```json
[{"name":"PhoneNumber","in":"path","description":"Phone number to check portability in e164 format.","schema":{"type":"string","format":"phone-number"},"x-twilio":{"pii":{"handling":"standard","deleteSla":0}},"required":true}]
```

### Query parameters

```json
[{"name":"TargetAccountSid","in":"query","description":"Account Sid to which the number will be ported. This can be used to determine if a sub account already has the number in its inventory or a different sub account. If this is not provided, the authenticated account will be assumed to be the target account.","schema":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^AC[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$"},"examples":{"fetch":{"value":"ACaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa02"}}},{"name":"AddressSid","in":"query","description":"Address Sid of customer to which the number will be ported.","schema":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^AD[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$"},"examples":{"fetch":{"value":"ADaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa02"}}}]
```

## Example Portability responses

### Portable phone number response

For a portable phone number, the response body will look similar to the following JSON example. The `portable` Boolean indicates whether or not the phone number can be ported into Twilio. The `pin_and_account_number_required` field that indicates if the phone number requires a PIN from the losing carrier as part of the porting process.

```json
{
   "phone_number": "YOUR_NUMBER",
   "portable": true,
   "url": "https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/Porting/Portability/PhoneNumber/YOUR_NUMBER",
   "country": "US",
   "not_portable_reason": null,
   "account_sid": null,
   "pin_and_account_number_required": false,
   "not_portable_reason_code": null,
   "number_type": "LOCAL"
}
```

### Not portable phone number response

For a phone number that is not portable, the response body will look similar to the following JSON example. The `portable` Boolean is `false`. Both the `not_portable_reason_code` and `not_portable_reason` fields provide additional details about why the phone number is not portable.

```json
{
   "phone_number": "YOUR_NUMBER",
   "portable": false,
   "url": "https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/Porting/Portability/PhoneNumber/YOUR_NUMBER",
   "country": "CO",
   "not_portable_reason": "UNSUPPORTED",
   "account_sid": null,
   "pin_and_account_number_required": true,
   "not_portable_reason_code": 22130,
   "number_type": "UNKNOWN"
}
```

Title: Port phone numbers using Twilio APIs
Source: md
Fetched (UTC): 2026-01-23 21:14:32Z
============================================================================================

# Port phone numbers using Twilio APIs

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Porting API is in Public Beta. The information in this document could change. We might add or update features before the product becomes Generally Available. Beta products don't have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Learn more about [beta product support](https://help.twilio.com/articles/115002413087-Twilio-Beta-product-support).

If you'd like to keep your own phone number and move its messaging and voice capabilities to Twilio, you can port your number to Twilio. In this case, Twilio will be the new carrier of the phone number.

This guide describes a step-by-step walkthrough of the automated porting process using the **Porting API**. With the API, you can create a port-in request for US non-toll-free phone numbers (up to 1,000 numbers per request).

Check the portability status of the phone numbers using the [Portability API](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/portability-api) (in Public Beta) prior to submitting a port-in request for these numbers.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> The public beta version of the Porting API doesn't support email notifications. You can configure [webhooks](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/porting-webhooks) to receive updates about your port-in request.

With this port-in process, you won't need to manually create a PDF document with a Letter of Authorization (LOA) to port a number. Twilio generates an electronic LOA with the information you provide in the port-in request and sends it to the authorized representative's email for a digital signature.

Once a port-in request is complete, you need to [fulfill all messaging and voice compliance requirements](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260800720410) before using a phone number for Twilio services.

## Phone number port-in process

![Flowchart of the phone number porting process involving authorized representative, Twilio customer, Twilio, and API.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/be9e530328b12150d10abe3baa63b864a6b99ff7bbcba84e63b9ac76216e8ff3.png)

The high-level steps for creating a port-in request using the API are as follows:

1. [Check the portability](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/portability-api) for all phone numbers in the request.
2. [Upload utility bills](/docs/phone-numbers/document-apis) showing proof of ownership for phone numbers to be ported.
3. [Create a new port-in request](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/port-in-request-api) for the phone numbers.
4. Twilio creates an LOA with all portable numbers from the port-in request and sends it to the authorized representative's email (added in the API) for digital signature.
5. The authorized representative of the number signs the LOA.
6. Twilio submits the request to the losing carrier.
7. Any port rejections are handled based on responses from the losing carrier.
8. Twilio confirms the date for the port with the losing carrier.
9. Twilio and the losing carrier complete the number port on the agreed date, and Twilio adds the phone numbers to your account.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> See [Porting webhooks](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/porting-webhooks) for more information about what notifications you can subscribe to as part of the port-in process.

## Statuses

The following tables list possible statuses for your port-in request and port in phone numbers.

### port-in request statuses

The port-in request status represents the overall status of the request, and updates as the request progresses through the port-in process.

| Status name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| In Review             | The port-in request is currently being reviewed by Twilio. The request will progress to the next status automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Waiting for Signature | The port-in request has been accepted by Twilio and an LOA has been sent to the authorized representative's email.<br />The authorized representative has 30 days to sign this document or the port-in request will be canceled automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| In Progress           | The port-in request has been submitted to the losing carrier and if accepted will get ported on the agreed date. The request will progress to the next status automatically.<br />It is only possible to make changes to the target port date of the port-in request at this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Action Required       | At least one number in the port-in request has been rejected by the losing carrier.

### Port in phone number statuses

A port-in request allows you to port multiple phone numbers at once. Each phone number in the request has its own status.

| Status                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In Review             | The port in phone number is currently being reviewed by Twilio. The phone number will progress to the next status automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Waiting for Signature | The LOA for the port-in request is waiting for a signature from the authorized representative. The phone number will progress to the next status as soon as the LOA is signed.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Port Submitted        | The phone number has been submitted to the losing carrier for port approval. The phone number will progress to the next status automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Port Pending          | The phone number port has been accepted by the losing carrier. At this point there should be a date assigned to the port-in request for this phone number. The phone number will progress to the next status automatically on the port in date.                                                                                                                      |
| Port Rejected         | The phone number has been rejected by the losing carrier. To resolve the rejection:<ol><li>Review the rejection reason code.</li><li>Do one of the following: <ul><li>Cancel the rejected phone number from the port-in request.</li><li>Cancel the entire port-in request.</li></ul></li><li>Resubmit the port-in request with the corrected information.</li></ol> |
| Completed             | The phone number has been successfully ported to Twilio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Canceling             | The phone number is pending cancellation. Some scenarios require you to reach out to the losing carrier or other partners to ensure cancellation. This is not a terminal status.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Canceled              | The phone number was canceled during the port-in process. This can happen automatically if the number is not portable or it can be done via the API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Port in phone numbers status transitions

## Authentication

To authenticate requests to the Twilio APIs, Twilio supports [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Use your *API key* as the username and your *API key secret* as the password. You can create an API key either [in the Twilio Console](/docs/iam/api-keys/keys-in-console) or [using the API](/docs/iam/api-keys/key-resource-v1).

**Note**: Twilio recommends using API keys for authentication in production apps. For local testing, you can use your Account SID as the username and your Auth token as the password. You can find your Account SID and Auth Token in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).

Learn more about [Twilio API authentication](/docs/usage/requests-to-twilio).

## Customer support

When you create a port-in request and provide a notification email, Twilio creates a Zendesk ticket for your request. This ticket tracks your port-in request status.

To create the ticket, add the email addresses as values of the [`NotificationEmails`](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/port-in-request-api) parameter. All included email addresses receive notifications about the port-in request status.

To communicate with Twilio about your request, you can use the ticket or reply to the email to add a new comment.

# PortIn resource

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Porting API is in Public Beta. The information in this document could change. We might add or update features before the product becomes Generally Available. Beta products don't have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Learn more about [beta product support](https://help.twilio.com/articles/115002413087-Twilio-Beta-product-support).

The PortIn resource represents a port-in request for a set of phone numbers to Twilio. A port-in request contains potentially many [phone numbers](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/port-in-phone-numbers). A port-in request allows you to group assets shared across multiple phone numbers, but every phone number is an independent resource. For example, you can use one LOA for all phone numbers in a single port-in request. Twilio generates the LOA based on the authorized representative information in the port-in request and other fields that are also shared for all phone numbers in that request. The [porting webhooks](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/porting-webhooks) and [PhoneNumber resources](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/port-in-phone-numbers) give you visibility and access to handle basic errors during the port-in process.

## Limitations

The PortIn resource has the following restrictions:

* Country available: United States
* Supported number types: Landline and mobile. Toll-free numbers are not currently supported.
* Maximum of 1,000 phone numbers per request.
* You must upload a utility bill using the [Documents API](/docs/phone-numbers/document-apis) prior to submitting the request.
* The Port In resource doesn't support moving an existing Twilio number from one account to another. See [Moving Twilio Phone Numbers to another Twilio Account](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223135327) in the Twilio Help Center to learn more.

## Cancel a port-in request

`DELETE https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/Porting/PortIn/{PortInRequestSid}`

To cancel a port-in request you can send a `DELETE` request to the API. This
will cancel the porting request and all associated phone number requests.
Twilio is only able to accept cancellations that occur more than 72 hrs before
the port in date.

# PortIn PhoneNumber subresource

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Porting API is in Public Beta. The information in this document could change. We might add or update features before the product becomes Generally Available. Beta products don't have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Learn more about [beta product support](https://help.twilio.com/articles/115002413087-Twilio-Beta-product-support).

The PhoneNumber subresource represents a single phone number within a port-in request. PhoneNumber is a subresource of the PortIn resource. You can get the `phoneNumberSid` of a phone number by [fetching a port-in request](/docs/phone-numbers/port-in/port-in-request-api#fetch-a-port-in-request).

## Delete a phone number from a port-in request

`DELETE https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/Porting/PortIn/{PortInRequestSid}/PhoneNumber/{PhoneNumberSid}`

Make a `DELETE` request to this endpoint to cancel a single phone number in a port-in request.

There are some restrictions on when you can cancel the port of a phone number. Twilio is only able to accept cancellations that occur more than 72 hours before the port in date.

### Path parameters

# Porting webhooks

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Porting API and webhooks are in Public Beta. The information in this document could change. We might add or update features before the product becomes Generally Available. Beta products don't have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Learn more about [beta product support](https://help.twilio.com/articles/115002413087-Twilio-Beta-product-support).

Porting webhooks send notifications about events associated with port-in requests and port-in phone numbers. The parent account receives all webhooks for any port-in requests created on the parent account or any subaccounts.

## Webhook Properties

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v1.porting_webhook_configuration_fetch","modelName":"numbers_v1_porting_webhook_configuration_fetch","properties":{"url":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The URL of the webhook configuration request"},"port_in_target_url":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The complete webhook url that will be called when a notification event for port in request or port in phone number happens"},"port_out_target_url":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The complete webhook url that will be called when a notification event for a port out phone number happens."},"notifications_of":{"type":"array","nullable":true,"description":"A list to filter what notification events to receive for this account and its sub accounts. If it is an empty list, then it means that there are no filters for the notifications events to send in each webhook and all events will get sent.","items":{"type":"string"}},"port_in_target_date_created":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"Creation date for the port in webhook configuration"},"port_out_target_date_created":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"Creation date for the port out webhook configuration"}}}

## Webhook API

Configure a webhook to receive the notifications of a port-in request or updates to an existing request. Requests overwrite any existing configurations.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> The Webhook configuration is tied to the account used to create the port-in request or its parent account.

### Example request

Configure Webhook

```bash
$ curl -X POST 'https://numbers.twilio.com/v1/Porting/Configuration/Webhook' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{

### Retry policy

Twilio retries each webhook request up to 10 times. The backoff interval doubles after each retry. Retries begin 5 minutes after the first attempt and stop after 21 hours.

### Webhooks security

Twilio uses [webhooks](/docs/usage/webhooks) to notify your application about events occurring in your Twilio products, sending these updates to the URL you configured. To safeguard the communication between Twilio and your web application, Twilio supports encryption and cryptographically signs its requests. These signatures ensure the authenticity of requests from Twilio. You can verify a request's legitimacy by following the guidelines in the [Twilio Security documentation](/docs/usage/security#validating-requests).

# AvailablePhoneNumber resource

The `AvailablePhoneNumbers` resource and its subresources let you search for local, toll-free, and mobile phone numbers that you can purchase. You can search for phone numbers that:

* Match a specific pattern
* Are in a specific country
* Belong to a particular area code (NPA) or exchange (NXX)
* Fall within a defined geographic region

To find available numbers, make a request to one of the following subresources:

* [AvailablePhoneNumbers Local subresource](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumberlocal-resource)
* [AvailablePhoneNumbers TollFree subresource](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumber-tollfree-resource)
* [AvailablePhoneNumbers Mobile subresource](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumber-mobile-resource)

> \[!NOTE]
>
> After you identify a number to purchase, provision it with the [Incoming Phone Numbers API](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource).

## Supported Countries and Types

To list the subresources available to your account in a given country, query the `AvailablePhoneNumbers` resource. For full information about our phone number support, see [Twilio phone number availability and their capabilities](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223183068) and [Twilio phone number types and their capabilities](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223135367). Each resource instance has the following properties.

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"api.v2010.account.available_phone_number_country","modelName":"api_v2010_account_available_phone_number_country","properties":{"country_code":{"type":"string","format":"iso-country-code","nullable":true,"description":"The [ISO-3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code of the country."},"country":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The name of the country."},"uri":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The URI of the Country resource, relative to `https://api.twilio.com`."},"beta":{"type":"boolean","nullable":true,"description":"Whether all phone numbers available in the country are new to the Twilio platform. `true` if they are and `false` if all numbers are not in the Twilio Phone Number Beta program."},"subresource_uris":{"type":"object","format":"uri-map","nullable":true,"description":"A list of related AvailablePhoneNumber resources identified by their URIs relative to `https://api.twilio.com`."}}}
```

## Fetch a specific country

`GET https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/AvailablePhoneNumbers/{CountryCode}.json`

### Path parameters

```json
[{"name":"AccountSid","in":"path","description":"The SID of the [Account](/docs/iam/api/account) requesting the available phone number Country resource.","schema":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^AC[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$"},"required":true},{"name":"CountryCode","in":"path","description":"The [ISO-3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code of the country to fetch available phone number information about.","schema":{"type":"string","format":"iso-country-code"},"required":true}]

# AvailablePhoneNumber Local resource

To find local phone numbers you can purchase, use the `AvailablePhoneNumbers Local` subresource.

## Focus your phone number search

To focus your search of available phone numbers, provide one or more of the following characteristics:

* A pattern within the phone number
* A state, province, country, or postal code for the phone number ([North American Numbering Plan (NANP)][nanp] numbers only)
* An area code or exchange
* A feature that phone number supports, like SMS

[nanp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan

Twilio seeks to keep a wide variety of phone numbers in stock at all times. To learn which countries Twilio supports, see [pricing](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/pricing).

# AvailablePhoneNumber TollFree resource

To find toll-free phone numbers you can purchase, use the `AvailablePhoneNumbers TollFree` subresource.

## Focus your phone number search

To focus your search of available phone numbers, provide one or more of the following characteristics:

* A pattern within the phone number
* A state, province, country, or postal code for the phone number ([North American Numbering Plan (NANP)][nanp] numbers only)
* An area code or exchange
* A feature that phone number supports, like SMS

[nanp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan

Twilio seeks to keep a wide variety of phone numbers in stock at all times. To learn which countries Twilio supports, see [pricing](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/pricing).

# AvailablePhoneNumber Mobile resource

To find mobile phone numbers you can purchase, use the `AvailablePhoneNumbers Mobile` subresource.

## Focus your phone number search

To focus your search of available phone numbers, provide one or more of the following characteristics:

* A pattern within the phone number
* A state, province, country, or postal code for the phone number ([North American Numbering Plan (NANP)][nanp] numbers only)
* An area code or exchange
* A feature that phone number supports, like SMS

[nanp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan

Twilio seeks to keep a wide variety of phone numbers in stock at all times. To learn which countries Twilio supports, see [pricing](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/pricing).

# IncomingPhoneNumber resource

An **IncomingPhoneNumber** instance resource represents a phone number that you provision, port, or host with Twilio.

The IncomingPhoneNumbers list resource represents an account's Twilio phone numbers. You can `POST` to the list resource to [provision a new Twilio number](/docs/phone-numbers/api/incomingphonenumber-resource). To find a number to provision, use the subresources of the [AvailablePhoneNumbers](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumber-resource) resource.

You can transfer phone numbers between two Twilio accounts if you're using [subaccounts](/docs/iam/api/subaccounts). For details, see [Exchanging Numbers Between Subaccounts](/docs/iam/api/subaccounts#exchanging-numbers).

> \[!NOTE]
>
> Provisioning a phone number is a two-step process:
>
> 1. Find an available phone number to provision by making a [`GET` request to the subresources of the AvailablePhoneNumbers resource](/docs/phone-numbers/api/availablephonenumber-resource).
> 2. Make a [`POST` request to the IncomingPhoneNumbers resource](#create-an-incomingphonenumber-resource).

> \[!WARNING]
>
> The order of columns in the CSV can change as we add fields to the API response. Design your application to handle column-order changes.

The following properties are available for the IncomingPhoneNumber resource:

## Delete an IncomingPhoneNumber resource

`DELETE https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/IncomingPhoneNumbers/{Sid}.json`

Deleting an IncomingPhoneNumber releases it from your account. Twilio will no longer answer calls to this number and will stop charging the monthly fee.

Twilio might reclaim and assign the number to another customer, so delete numbers with caution. If you make a mistake, contact [Twilio Support](https://help.twilio.com/). We might be able to give you the number back.

### Path parameters

Title: Console: Getting Started with Phone Number Regulatory Compliance
Source: md
Fetched (UTC): 2026-01-23 21:14:37Z
============================================================================================

# Console: Getting Started with Phone Number Regulatory Compliance

Use the [Twilio Console](https://twilio.com/console) to provision phone numbers legally. This ensures that:

* Your phone numbers are not at risk of getting revoked.
* You can operate your business' communications locally.

For answers to common questions, see [Phone Number Regulatory FAQ](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq).

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to get started with Phone Number Regulatory Compliance:

1. Review the Phone Numbers Regulatory Compliance Guidelines for your region.
2. Collect the required documentation from end-users.
3. Log in to the Twilio Console.
4. In the Console navigation, select **Phone Numbers** > **Regulatory Compliance**.
5. Create a Regulatory Bundle and submit it for review.
6. Wait for Twilio to review the Regulatory Bundle.
7. After Twilio approves the Regulatory Bundle, assign it to the relevant phone numbers.
8. Wait for Twilio to review the Regulatory Bundle assigned to phone number(s) — the review process will take up to 3 business days.

### Step 1: Go to the Phone Numbers Regulatory Compliance Guidelines

First, go to the [Phone Number Regulatory Requirements for Customers](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory) to see what local regulators require.

Let's say we own a chain of pizza shops. We need to make sure all of our German Local phone numbers are compliant. We're going to select Germany from the dropdown.

![Dropdown showing Germany under Regulatory Requirements by Country.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/bd6736614c1f3ce962f71dd4b3eade54355c787dd0e816955244677e88f26917.png)

After selecting Germany from the dropdown and finding Local Business phone numbers for a business, we can find the regulation we need to follow. The regulation has a list of required information with accompanied Supporting Documents and a proof requirement.

![Table showing business requirements: name and address with proof of identity and local address documentation.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/b9cd0f9709e0707e91de90944338d12d04ebaaee7a95314662fc0cf18c0da7ff.png)

### Step 2: Collect documentation from the end users

Next, you'll need to collect the required information with accompanying Supporting Documents from the end-user.

**Note**: There is a limit to how old the supporting documents can be. See our FAQ for more information: [Is there a limit on how old supporting documentation can be?](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq#q-is-there-a-limit-on-how-old-supporting-documentation-can-be)

End-users are the people who will answer the phone call or receive the message.

In this scenario, we are the End-Users who will provision German Local phone numbers for our business purposes. No one but us will answer the phone.

We'll collect an excerpt from the commercial register (called a Handelsregisterauszug in Germany) showing the local address.

![List of information and documentation required.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/eb4f94a9b30efc2988ac963e77a39859c74d844ce8a11eaf09d3b955e2c3c6ee.png)

### Step 3: Log into the Twilio Console

[Log in to your account](https://www.twilio.com/console)

### Step 4: Go to Phone Numbers > Regulatory Compliance

In the left-hand navigation panel of the Console, click to expand the **Phone Numbers** option. Then click on **Regulatory Compliance**.

![Navigation menu with Phone Numbers section expanded to Regulatory Compliance.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/981842d2c111ef283433a2efef5dce3cb5256811ee724f496e9eb80a9751ff3f.jpg)

Next, click on **Bundles** to access your existing Regulatory Bundles or to create a new Bundle:

![Twilio Console page for creating a new regulatory bundle with instructions and filter options.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/0ddcb49f1ee81bda6058d8fc4c83503931064afabca552956d11bcb94d8abc86.jpg)

For a one-click shortcut to the Bundles section of the Console, click on this link: [https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/regulatory-compliance/bundles](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/regulatory-compliance/bundles)

### Step 5: Create a Regulatory Bundle and submit it for review

On the Bundles page, click on the **Create a Regulatory Bundle** button.

In this scenario, we want to make sure all of our German Local phone numbers for our example pizza chain business are compliant. We'll select **Germany** as the *Phone Number's Country* and **Local** as the *Type of Phone Number*.

![Select Germany and local type for phone number compliance.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/54b06489840390055e5d316cdc503b06a5d45af45cf55100fd1ee9638642e470.jpg)

Select **Business** as the end user.

![Select Business as the end user for Germany local phone numbers.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/5ea51129530a6b031aecd9d7a6f720acef20844518efa6570a1ea39186c9c44c.jpg)

Once you click the **Next** button at the end of the second section, Twilio saves a *Draft* of your Regulatory Bundle. Go through each step within the form. When you're ready, click on the button that says **Submit for review**.

#### Deleting Regulatory Bundle drafts

Regulatory Bundles in **Draft** status can be deleted from your account. To delete a Bundle draft, click the *Delete Regulatory Bundle* button at the bottom of the Bundle instance page. You will need to confirm that you're sure you want to delete this Bundle draft.

Deleting a Regulatory Bundle will unassign any End-Users and Supporting Documents associated with the Bundle. However, these objects will not be deleted. Once you click the **Delete** button, the Regulatory Bundle will be deleted immediately. You will not be able to undo this action.

### Step 6: Wait for Twilio to review the Regulatory Bundle

When you submit your Regulatory Bundle, Twilio validates that all information conforms to local regulatory guidelines.

**Note**: The review process generally takes up to three business days, but in some regions it might take several weeks.

### Step 7: Assign the Regulatory Bundle to phone numbers after approval

Twilio will email you when the status of the Regulatory Bundle has changed to **Approved**.

Within the Twilio Console, go to the **Regulatory Information** tab of the Phone Number that you want to make compliant. Select the Bundle or Address you would like to assign to the phone number.

Only approved Bundles that match the phone number type appear in the drop-down list. You can't map a Bundle in **Rejected** or **Pending Review** status to a phone number.

In this example, we'll assign the Regulatory Bundle that fulfills regulatory requirements for German Local phone number for Business purposes to a German Local phone number.

#### Examples of Regulatory Bundle and phone number mappings

In the following example, we assign the Regulatory Bundle that fulfills the regulatory requirements for an Australia Mobile phone number for Individual purposes to an Australian Mobile phone number.

![Regulatory bundle mapping for phone number +61412340755 with compliant status.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/a8b35f96f1f79072fff75b5e70cc31c366b1d1984afa07c43ac6f18be26768cb.png)

The following table shows the possible combinations of requirements, Regulatory Bundles, and addresses.

| **Requirements**                                    | **What you need to do**                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regulatory Bundle Requirement & Address Requirement | You need to assign the phone number to a Regulatory Bundle and an Address. |
| Regulatory Bundle Requirement only                  | You need to assign the phone number to a Regulatory Bundle *only*.         |
| Address Requirement only                            | You need to assign the phone number to an Address *only*.                  |

### Step 8: Wait for Twilio to review the Regulatory Bundle assigned to phone numbers

When you assign your Regulatory Bundle to a phone number and save it, Twilio sets the status to [*Pending Review*](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/console-regulatory-compliance-report#criteria-for-regulatory-compliance-mappings) and reviews your submission. The review process generally takes up to three business days, but in some regions it might take several weeks.

You can change the Bundle or Address SID that the phone number is mapped to at any time.

> \[!WARNING]
>
> Changing a phone number mapping restarts the review process.

The following table describes the possible status values and what actions you need to take:

| Status                 | What it means                                                                                                                                                                          | What you need to do                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

# Console: Regulatory Compliance Report Getting Started

> \[!WARNING]
>
> The Phone Number Regulatory Compliance Report Console is currently in Public Beta and changes will continue to be rolled out while Twilio strives to move Phone Number Regulatory Compliance to GA.

## How it Works

The Phone Numbers Regulatory Compliance Report displays all your regulated phone numbers, the overall compliance status, and a quick link to individually map each phone number. The Regulatory Compliance Report will help you understand which of your phone numbers are in compliance, not in compliance, or require a compliance review by Twilio's regulatory reviewers.

Please read [Twilio's Regulatory Compliance requirements](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory) to understand what supporting documents and information you must supply to ensure your phone numbers are compliant with local telephony regulations. For more information, please visit the [Phone Number Regulatory FAQ](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq).

### Criteria for regulatory compliance mappings

There are two main components of Phone Number Regulatory Compliance - Proof of Identity and Proof of Address. Complying with phone number regulations consists of providing data and/or documentation so that you can prove your address and/or identity. The exact requirements depend on the type of phone number (e.g., toll-free vs. local) and the country of origin of the phone number.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> Remember that there are ***two*** steps to compliance:
>
> * Provide your address and/or identity
> * Map, or link, your phone numbers to the appropriate address and identity.
>
> We need to know which phone number goes with which address and identity. Don't forget that second step.
>
> *Emergency Address Registration is a different type of regulation which isn't part of the regulatory compliance requirements for number ownership. Therefore, the Emergency Address Registration status is not included in this compliance report.*

### Status of regulatory compliance mappings

There are currently three statuses of a phone number's regulatory compliance mapping:

1. *Pending Review* - the Proof of Identity and/or Proof of Address mapping to the phone number requires Twilio's review.
2. *Compliant* - The Proof of Identity and/or Proof of Address mapping to the phone number has been verified by Twilio to be regulatory compliant.
3. *Not Compliant* - The Proof of Identity and/or Proof of Address mapping to the phone number has been verified by Twilio to **not** be regulatory compliant.

### Navigating the Compliance Report

To use the Phone Number Compliance Report for all your phone numbers that are regulated by the origin country's telephony regulator, navigate to the [Compliance Report](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/regulatory-compliance/compliance-report?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%2Fphone-numbers%2Fregulatory-compliance%2Fcompliance-report%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1) in the phone number's section of Console. To view the regulated phone numbers in your account and their current compliance status, first filter the results by the phone number country and phone number type. If you have regulated phone numbers in that country, the results will be listed on the page, as shown below.

![Compliance report for Germany shows phone number under pending review status.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/cc9cb3d04a4fe72002896adf712f0115df9224cc0544516856ecd05dfd5b7ddc.jpg)

> \[!NOTE]
>
> When viewing the list of all the regulated phone numbers in your account and their compliance status, you can identify which phone numbers are marked as "non-compliant" that need your attention. Click on the **Map to Identity Document and Address** link to navigate to the regulatory information for that specific phone number. From there, you'll be able to choose which Identity and/or Address you should map to that specific phone number.

============================================================================================

# How to Find a BU SID or an AD SID

Sometimes, you may need to find an ID for an identity document bundle or address in your account. The system uses these IDs to make sure we have the right regulatory information for you.

A BU SID and an AD SID are identifiers linked to different parts of your account:

* BU SID - A unique identifier *for an identity bundle* in your account
* AD SID - A unique identifier *for an address* in your account

If you need to find a BU SID and/or an AD SID, just follow these steps:

1. Log into the [Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
2. Click on Phone Numbers and then on the **[Regulatory Compliance](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/regulatory-compliance/bundles)** link.

   * If you do not have the Phone Numbers option follow this guide for [how to modify the product links in console](https://help.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006662093-How-do-I-modify-the-product-links-in-the-console-).

## v2 RC APIs Workflow \[#v2-rc-api]

In the new v2 service, many of the objects will be re-usable. The re-usability of objects allows you to build and construct `Regulatory Bundles` at scale without having to create the same `End-User` or `Supporting Document` for each number group that you wish to lease.

The workflow for v2 below depicts both the `Regulatory Bundles` and `Supporting Documents` state machines. These workflows are crucial to providing a scalable and transparent process for both Twilio's customers and Twilio's customer's end-users through critical [PII](/docs/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information-pii) abstraction.

## Read a Regulation of a Bundle \[#regulation-read]

Before creating a new `Regulatory Bundle`, you will need to understand the requirements of a Regulation.

A Regulation instance unique per `IsoCountry`, `NumberType`, and `EndUserType` .

## Create a new Regulatory Bundles \[#bundle-create]

To begin the process of creating a new `Regulatory Bundle`, you will need to specify either the following three parameters:

`IsoCountry`, `NumberType`, and `EndUserType`

or

the `RegulationSid`.

Either of those options will provide the metadata required to create the `Regulatory Bundle` container for `Supporting Documents` and `End-Users` to be assigned to.

### Request body parameters

## Create a new End-User \[#end-user-create]

Once you successfully create the Bundle, you will either need to create a *new* `End-User`. If you have an End-User you've already created that you'd like to use, you can bypass this step.

The `End-User` is the `individual` or `business` that answers the phone call or message - whichever type you selected in the destination `Regulatory Bundle` container.

The end-user's information will be sent to the regulating body of the phone number's originating country.

## Create a new Supporting Document \[#supporting-document-create]

For regulated number groups, documentation is required. This supporting documentation can vary from metadata to a file upload requirement.

The `Supporting Documents` resource allows you to create and manage `Supporting Documents` that can be assigned to multiple `Regulatory Bundle` containers.

### Request body parameters

```json

### Create a new Supporting Document with file upload \[#file-upload]

Some regulations require a Supporting Document to upload proof. Proof for Twilio is the actual document that you would present during an in-person transaction.

The file upload has the same request parameters as the `Supporting Document` create, but with two significant differences: the base URI should be `https://numbers-upload.twilio.com` and you'll need to change *--data-urlencode* to `-F` as shown in the example.

Create a Supporting Document with a file upload

```bash
ATTRIBUTES=$(cat << EOF
{
    "address_sids": ["ADXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"],
    "document_number": "312454", 
    "business_name": "Twilio",
    "issue_date": "2019-11-15"
}
EOF
)

curl -X POST https://numbers-upload.twilio.com/v2/RegulatoryCompliance/SupportingDocuments \
-F "Attributes=$ATTRIBUTES" \
-F "FriendlyName=Twilio GmbH" \
-F "Type=business_registration" \
-F "File=@twilio_business_registration.png" \
-u ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:your_auth_token
```

```json
{
    "account_sid": "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "attributes": {
        "business_name": "Twilio",
        "document_number": "312454",
        "issue_date": "2019-11-15",

    },

## Create an Item Assignment of a Bundle \[#item-assignment-create]

Once you have created all the various End-User, Supporting Documents, and Addresses, the next step is to `Assign Items` to the `Regulatory Bundle`.

### Path parameters

```json
[{"name":"BundleSid","in":"path","description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource.","schema":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BU[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$"},"required":true}]
```

### Request body parameters

```json
{"schema":{"type":"object","title":"CreateItemAssignmentRequest","required":["ObjectSid"],"properties":{"ObjectSid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^[a-zA-Z]{2}[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","description":"The SID of an object bag that holds information of the different items."}}},"examples":{"create":{"value":{"lang":"json","value":"{\n  \"ObjectSid\": \"ITaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"\n}","meta":"","code":"{\n  \"ObjectSid\": \"ITaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"\n}","tokens":[["{","#C9D1D9"],"\n  ",["\"ObjectSid\"","#7EE787"],[":","#C9D1D9"]," ",["\"ITaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"","#A5D6FF"],"\n",["}","#C9D1D9"]],"annotations":[],"themeName":"github-dark","style":{"color":"#c9d1d9","background":"#0d1117"}}}},"encodingType":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded","conditionalParameterMap":{}}

## Submit Regulatory Bundle \[#submit-bundle]

Once you've succeeded in *Assigning* all the required *Items* to the `Regulatory Bundle`, the final step is to submit the `Regulatory Bundle` for review. The status of the `Regulatory Bundle` will transition to `pending-review`.

### Path parameters

```json
[{"name":"Sid","in":"path","description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource.","schema":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BU[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$"},"required":true}]
```

### Request body parameters

Title: API Getting Started: Compliance Information Update
Source: md
Fetched (UTC): 2026-01-23 21:14:38Z
============================================================================================

# API Getting Started: Compliance Information Update

> \[!NOTE]
>
> For general information about Regulatory Compliance APIs, go to [Regulatory Compliance API Docs](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api).

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is meant to serve developers who use Twilio's Regulatory Compliance APIs to build their own application that serves. By following this Getting Started guide, you as a developer can implement a self-service mechanism for your customers to update their compliance information without you manually having to communicate with them.

### New API Resources

* [Copies Resource](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/copies-resource)
* [Replace Items Resource](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/replace-items-resource)

### New API Parameter

A new parameter, `ValidUntil`, is being added to the [Bundles resource](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles). This new parameter is applied to a Bundle in the `twilio-approved` state but will be transitioned to a `twilio-rejected` state unless the compliance information is updated.

## How do I update compliance information?

The first step is to know when a [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) is updated that will create a call-to-action for you to update the compliance information of your affected Bundles. To do this, you should have a status callback webhook enabled for all of your Bundles. An email alias is required, so all information will always be sent to the email assigned to any affected Bundle. Once the Bundles have been identified, you will create a copy to begin updating all compliance information required. After updating the compliance information, submit the Bundle to Twilio for review. Once Twilio reviews and approves the newly updated compliance information, you will then replace all of the newly updated items to the original Bundle. This prevents you from having to reassign any dependencies such as Phone Numbers to a new Bundle. After the items have been replaced, delete the Bundle Copy to ensure you have a clean reference moving forward. Once completed, the Bundle will no longer have a `ValidUntil` date and everything is up to current compliance.

1. Find all Bundles that require information to be updated/added
2. Create a Bundle Copy to begin updating/adding information
3. Run an Evaluation to find the exact incorrect or missing piece of information
4. Retrieve list of Supporting Document(s) and End-User assigned to the Bundle
5. Present and update Supporting Document(s) - *\[optional, if needs updating]*
6. Present and update End-User - *\[optional, if needs updating]*
7. Submit Bundle Copy for review
8. Twilio reviews & approves Bundle
9. After approval, replace Item Assignments from Bundle Copy to original Bundle
10. Delete Bundle Copy

## API Sequence Diagram

Below is an API sequence diagram illustrating the sequence of requests that will be performed within this Getting Started page of updating compliance information. The domain objects are abbreviated for brevity purposes.

![Sequence diagram showing customer compliance update process via Twilio APIs.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/951d914b760dade4c1c31e37a2095593dd0358149801ea455116df92f418399c.png)

### Step 0: Twilio will enact new requirements for a current active Regulation

If you have configured the status callback webhook parameter on the Bundle, you will receive the following webhook request. Notice that there is a new field in the response; `ValidUntil` that acts as a date parameter when the Bundle will be moved to a `twilio-rejected` status unless the compliance information is updated. If you do not remember how to configure your status callback webhook, please refer to the [Bundles Public API resource page](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles). There is a table within the page that details the [status callback parameters](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles#status-callback).

```json
{
   "account_sid":"ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "bundle_sid":"BUef3a237936fb63163fd852d77c5ba27b",
   "status":"twilio-approved",
   "valid_until":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z",
   "failure_reason":""
}

```

### Step 1: Filter for all Bundles

Besides the status callback webhooks and the email, your customers will need to filter all of their Bundles every time their job is to update compliance information. To find all of the Bundles that need their compliance information updated, Query the list of Bundles and apply the `ValidUntil` filter along with order by date descending.

Filter LIST for all \`twilio-approved\` Bundles with a \`ValidUntilDate\`

  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Copy of the Bundle

After receiving the initial status callback webhook request, the next step is to take the Bundle SID from webhook request which included the *`valid_until`* parameter and create a new Copy of the Bundle. The new Bundle Copy will make a new instance of the Bundle and all of the [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) consisting of an End-User and Supporting Document(s). These instances will allow you to update information while the original Bundle continues to stay in a `twilio-approved` compliance state that allows you to continue provisioning new Phone Numbers.

***Note:*** By performing this operation via Public API, you are opting in to the full API lifecycle after the Bundle Copy has been approved. If the Bundle Copy operation is performed via Twilio's Console, the Bundle will opt-in to automated lifecycle transitioning after Twilio has reviewed and approved the Bundle Copy. For API operation, it is up to you to coordinate that lifecycle transition and management.

Create new Bundle Copy to begin Updating

```js
// Download the helper library from https://www.twilio.com/docs/node/install
const twilio = require("twilio"); // Or, for ESM: import twilio from "twilio";

// Find your Account SID and Auth Token at twilio.com/console
// and set the environment variables. See http://twil.io/secure
const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;

### Step 3: Determine why a newly updated Regulation will reject the Bundle Copy

After understanding that a given Bundle will be valid until an expiration date and then creating a Bundle Copy, the next step is to understand what exactly is missing from the [Bundle Copy](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/copies-resource). To retrieve the exact requirements of what information passed versus not, send a new create request to the [Evaluations subresource](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/evaluations) of the Bundle instance. The response will provide the necessary information to add/remove any compliance information enforced by the new requirements of the [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations).

Create new Evaluation of Bundle Copy to fill in what's missing

```js
// Download the helper library from https://www.twilio.com/docs/node/install
const twilio = require("twilio"); // Or, for ESM: import twilio from "twilio";

// and set the environment variables. See http://twil.io/secure

const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;
const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken);

### Step 4: Find Supporting Documents and End-Users to Update

Go through the necessary steps to update the newly created Bundle Copy by either adding/removing information to the End-User and/or Supporting Document(s) assigned. Firstly, Retrieve a list of all Item Assignments from the Bundle Copy. Next step is to fetch the End-User instance (IT prefix) and the Supporting Document instance(s) (RD prefix). Analyzing the difference between the previously ran Evaluation against the End-User and Supporting Document(s) instances will allow you to see the exact parameters that need to be updated.

Retrieve a list of Item Assignments to update

const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;
const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken);

async function listItemAssignment() {
  const itemAssignments = await client.numbers.v2.regulatoryCompliance
    .bundles("BU504eddd19f1efa428458f6daed683667")
    .itemAssignments.list({ limit: 20 });

  itemAssignments.forEach((i) => console.log(i.sid));
}

listItemAssignment();
```

### Step 5: Update Supporting Document(s)

If the Evaluation that you previously requested determines that one or many Supporting Documents are missing information given the new requirements, you must update that information. First, show the user the Supporting Document instance and inform them exactly what is missing per the Evaluation. Allow the user to enter the information required and send an update operation for that instance. If there are more Supporting Documents that failed the Evaluation, repeat this step until finished.

Fetch the Supporting Document(s) instance

### Step 6: Update End User

If the Evaluation that you previously requested determines that the End User is missing information given the new requirements, you must update that information. First, show the user the End-User instance and inform them exactly what is missing per the Evaluation. Allow the user to enter the information required and send an update operation for that instance.

Fetch the End-User Instance

  }
}
```

### Step 8: Twilio to Review Regulatory Bundle Copy

After receipt, Twilio will review the Bundle Copy within [24 hours business SLA](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq). If approved, you will

```json
{
   "account_sid":"ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
   "bundle_sid":"BU504eddd19f1efa428458f6daed683667",
   "status":"twilio-approved",
   "failure_reason":""
}

```

***Note:*** If your Regulatory Bundle was rejected to one or more Supporting Document issues, you will be allowed to self-service fix your Supporting Documents by leveraging the `FailureReason` on the Supporting Document instances. By first referencing the Bundle Copy Item Assignments resource and then traversing to the Supporting Document instances for more detailed `FailureReason` information.

### Step 9: Replace Item Assignments

After the Bundle Copy has been reviewed and approved, it is up to you to replace the newly approved End-User Supporting Document(s) to the original Bundle. Once replaced, the valid until date parameter on the Bundle will be nulled out. By replacing only the Item Assignments, no Phone Numbers nor any other dependencies will have to be replacing and the history of the Bundle can continue.

***Note:*** as explained in Step 1, by creating the Bundle Copy via Public API, you are responsible for replacing the Item Assignments and deleting the Bundle Copy after approval.

Replace Item Assignments

### Step 10: Delete Bundle Copy

To clean up any leftover data that no longer has a purpose to you or Twilio, you should now the `Bundle Copy`. The Bundle Copy no longer has any `Item Assignments` and thus is no longer usable.

***Note:*** as explained in Step 1, by creating the Bundle Copy via Public API, you are responsible for replacing the Item Assignments and deleting the Bundle Copy after approval.

Delete Bundle Copy

// and set the environment variables. See http://twil.io/secure
const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;
const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken);

async function deleteBundle() {

============================================================================================

# Console Getting Started: Compliance Information Update

## **How To Guide: Update Compliance Information when Regulations change**

Learn how to update your Compliance Information in Regulatory Bundles assigned to Phone Numbers that have recently inhibited a regulatory requirement change. The new interface allows Console users to update their compliance information without risking their Phone Number becoming non-compliant or worse with communication outages. The process to update compliance information allows for a safe and scalable way for customers to meet new compliance without feeling overwhelmed through the delivery of transparency.

### **About this guide**

This guide will describe the background knowledge and steps required to update compliance information when Regulations are updated. Readers of this guide should be skilled Console operators who understand the basis of Twilio's Phone Number Compliance. The guide will serve as an execution of what's needed to utilize Twilio's new Compliance interface and clearly document the process of updating compliance information to comply with new requirements of Regulations. Updating Regulation requirements has a profound impact on Twilio's customers with potentially devastating business implications if not handled properly.

Check out Twilio's blog on [Reducing Admin Time & Expediting Phone Number Compliance](https://www.twilio.com/blog/reducing-admin-time-expediting-phone-number-compliance) for more information.

## **Update Compliance Information**

When country regulators/carriers change the compliance requirements of Phone Number provisioning, Twilio must update the [Regulation(s)](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) to reflect the new regulatory requirements. Twilio may have the option to allow customers a period of time from when the Regulation is updated until they can no longer provision new Phone Numbers due to their compliance information Regulatory Bundle being transitioned to a `twilio-rejected` status. For a list of other possible statuses, please refer [here](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq#q-what-are-the-different-statuses). To prevent any non-compliance, customers will receive an automated email after a Regulation has been updated. A link in the email will navigate to a list of Regulatory Bundles in their Console.

![Flowchart illustrating Twilio's regulation compliance process, from mandate notification to updating customer information and provisioning numbers.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/65e610e37fe81fe1def4d232efdcccd7ca5c36abe961e3260970d04a448b1f2d.jpg)

### **Step 0: Receive Regulation Update email**

Customers will receive Regulation updates via the email detailed in any of the compliance information Regulatory Bundles. The email will detail which Regulation has changed, for which account, and when the Regulatory Bundles will expire. There is a button that directs viewers of the email to Twilio's Console listing out all Regulatory Bundles.

Below is a short illustrative video depicting the customer experience for a Console user when Regulations update. The video goes through the process of how they are informed and then act upon the newly implemented Regulation updates.

![Twilio notification for regulatory updates; review bundles before June 20, 2022. Includes account, bundle names, and expiration dates.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/11665524d1cec6f0a9d1242b676903878b53b7e90d99f16faeb913bbdb046123.png)

### **Step 1: Find all Regulatory Bundles in Console**

After clicking on the "Review Regulatory Bundles" link in the email, the user will be directed to Twilio's Console (if logged in) listing out all Regulatory Bundles. Make sure to click on "Filter Bundles that require an update" to only view the list of Regulatory Bundles requiring action.

![Regulatory Bundles dashboard showing bundle status, expiry, and update requirements for example mobile numbers.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/741e5e977c3e0a7c666d63cada290d0e299583abc1972642b3b36dd31517eb21.png)

### **Step 2: Acknowledge Review needed to Copy Regulatory Bundle**

When clicking on a Regulatory Bundle that requires an update of compliance information, a modal will prompt you to request a Regulatory Bundle copy. The Regulatory Bundle copy allows you to begin updating your compliance information without risking any non-compliance with active Phone Number communication. The copy also permits you to continue provisioning new Phone Numbers while updating the compliance information in the copy.

![Twilio regulatory bundle update notification with compliance deadline, individual information, and supporting documents required.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/ef88085e9c0fcd75e1107e871f3292f8bfc117819c8aa7ed56d5bdd5a162523e.png)

### **Step 3: Review Regulatory Bundle Copy**

After you accept the terms and conditions stated within the modal and begin to update your Regulatory Bundle, a Copy of the Regulatory Bundle will be created. The Regulatory Bundle Copy will include a link to the original Regulatory Bundle that can still be used for provisioning new Phone Numbers. A new parameter will be exposed that indicates when the Regulatory Bundle Copy needs to be approved by Twilio. Inspecting the compliance information within the Regulatory Bundle, you can find which new information is missing and needs to be updated.

![Example Twilio bundle details with expiration date, SID, and individual info; missing family register information indicated.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/14e099a20021c4d58263d43f493251a93c709ac3ca8a464778f1b82d4ca6b970.png)

### **Step 4: Update Supporting Document(s)**

After determining whether it is a Supporting Document or End-User that needs to be updated, click on that instance and begin to fill in missing information before saving.

![Missing individual information needs completion for the draft form, including name of family register.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/8ccddb939a6a488645bf026009b408cd71316dcda7afe3a12b36ea2de289f36e.png)

### **Step 5: Submit Regulatory Bundle Copy**

Once you have filled in and saved all missing compliance information required for the updated Regulation, hit `Submit for review` to send the Regulatory Bundle Copy to Twilio for review.

![Regulatory compliance page displaying personal and document information, with a "Submit for review" button highlighted.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/86e7cc1eac5da9d1074411abece8a65e2bc83d7d40c1c7e4f5c5c263ba1d260d.png)

### **Step 6: Wait 24 business hours for Twilio to review**

Twilio has a 24 business hour SLA detailed in the [Regulatory FAQ](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq#q-how-long-does-it-take-twilio-to-verify-documents-that-have-been-submitted). The status bar of the Regulatory Bundle Copy will sit in the `Updates in review` state until Twilio has reviewed and either approves or rejects the newly updated compliance information.

![Twilio bundle update in review for the example; submission required before expiration date.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/8a74edaf5ddfde849fc29a065dee116f6bbd2afadcb57ddc6095f932db3417d8.png)

### **Step 7: Twilio Reviews & Approves**

When Twilio accepts the Regulatory Bundle Copy, Twilio will automatically delete the Regulatory Bundle Copy, transfer the Supporting Documents and End-User assignments from the Copy to the original, and remove the expiration date from the original. This prevents confusion of which Regulatory Bundle to use and allows you to continue using the same Regulatory Bundle without having to reassign any Phone Numbers or risking non-compliance.

![Example Twilio-approved bundle with provisioning SID, individual information, and supporting documents listed.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/1c5b9c4833c72952bbdd29e2994828a66524c393e0b64c692084b14a6f0fe452.png)

### **Step 8: Regulatory Bundle Items Transferred from Copy to Provisioning Bundle**

After Twilio reviews and approves the Bundle for update, the Bundle will automatically be deleted after the Supporting Document(s), End-User, and other associated metadata are transferred to the original Regulatory Bundle for provisioning Phone Numbers. The `valid\_until` date will be removed and the Regulatory Bundle will no longer be marked as update required.

# Regulatory Compliance REST APIs

> \[!NOTE]
>
> The Compliance Embeddable is a new offering that allows independent software vendors (ISVs) to onboard their end customers without integrating with the Regulatory Compliance API. By integrating the Compliance Embeddable into your website as an iframe component, you can enable self-service Regulatory Compliance Bundle submission. [Learn more about the Compliance Embeddable and sign up for the pilot.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTIMOIAzZ4iPatouQzlIWZQtuiKKF9sX6jfzXzvet1WzIYCKK1xiMucpihzYgqBb-Qg4rZ8tpKUiURm/pub)

## Resources

The following resources are available with the v2 Regulatory Compliance platform.

### Bundles Resource

[Bundles Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles)

The Twilio Bundles REST API allows you to create empty Regulatory Bundle containers. The Regulatory Bundles are [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) of [End-Users](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) and [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) for regulatory compliance.

Depending on the configuration of the bundle, the bundle is being assessed against a [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) (e.g., Germany local phone numbers for a business). Different [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) need [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) combinations of [End-User Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types) and [Supporting Document Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types).

### Bundle Copies Resource

[Bundle Copies API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/copies-resource)

When [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) are updated, customers and end-users are directed to begin updating their compliance information. To begin updating Bundles that are marked as information update required, the first step is to create a Bundle Copy to begin updating the relevant information. Once the new information has been approved, the next step is to [replace the original Bundle Items](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/replace-items-resource). For more detailed information, please refer to the [compliance information update API getting started guide](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/api-getting-started-compliance-information-update).

### Bundle Clones Resource

[Bundle Clones API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/clones-resource)

### Bundle Replace Items Resource

[Bundle Replace Items API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/replace-items-resource)

When [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) are updated, customers and end-users are directed to begin updating their compliance information. After creating a Bundle Copy and submitting the updated Bundles that are marked as information update required and the Bundle Copy being approved, Once the new information has been approved, the next step is to replace the original Bundle Items. For more detailed information, please refer to the [compliance information update API getting started guide](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/api-getting-started-compliance-information-update)

### End-Users Resource

[End-Users Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users)

The Twilio End-User REST API allows you to create End-Users to follow [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations). The End-User is the entity that answers the phone call or receives the message of a phone number. An entity can be either an `individual` or a `business`. You can find more information about the possible End-Users by referencing [End-User Type resource](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types).

You will [Assign Items](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) to an End-User of a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) with [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents). For applications that manage many End-Users, you will need to ensure that you assign the End-User instance to the correct Bundle instance to be in compliance with regulations.

### End-Users Type Resource

[End-User Types Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types)

The Twilio End-User Type resource of Twilio's Regulatory Compliance API informs you which type of end-user you can create and what the values are. Once you know which end-user type you want to create and the required values, you will create using the [End-User resource](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users). Each End-User Type has a different set of values required to be compliant.

You will [Assign Items](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) to an End-User of a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) with [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents). For applications that manage many End-Users, you will need to ensure that you assign the End-User instance to the correct Bundle instance to be in compliance with regulations.

### Supporting Documents Resource

[Supporting Documents Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents)

The Supporting Documents resource of Twilio's Regulatory Compliance APIs allows you to create new Supporting Documents with metadata to fulfill [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations). Each [Supporting Document Type](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types) may need different information to be compliant, so be sure to pass all of the correct values when creating a new Supporting Document Type.

A collection of Supporting Documents [Assigned as Items](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) to a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) along with an [End-User](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) satisfies a [Regulation](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory).

### Supporting Document Types Resource

[Supporting Document Types Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types)

The Supporting Document Type resource of Twilio's Regulatory Compliance API informs you which type of document you create and what the values are. You will then create a new [Supporting Document](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) with the correct type and values.

Each [Supporting Document Type](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types) may need different information to be compliant. Supporting Documents [Assigned as Items](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) to a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) along with an [End-User](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) satisfy a [Regulation](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory).

### Item Assignments Resource

[Item Assignments Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments)

The Twilio Item Assignments REST API allows you to assign [End-Users](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) and [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) to [Regulatory Bundles](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles).

The configuration of the Regulatory Bundle must pass a [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) (e.g., *Germany* *local* phone numbers for a *business*). Different [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) need [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) combinations of [End-User Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types) and [Supporting Document Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types).

With the correct items assigned to the [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles), you can *submit* the bundle by changing its status. After submission, the Twilio regulatory reviewers will review the Regulatory Bundle.

### Regulations Resource

[Regulations Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations)

The Twilio Regulatory Compliance REST API allows you to view and understand Regulations. Regulations are requirements based on [End-Users](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) and [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) set for by each country's government. A Regulation dictates the [Regulatory Bundles](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) composition of [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments).

***Note:*** Regulations can and do change. Please make sure not to hardcode any regulation within your application. The Regulation resource is for you to call and populate the values required for regulatory compliance.

### Evaluations

[Evaluations Resource API Doc](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/evaluations)

The Evaluations Resource allows developers to understand *what* failed and *why* when a Regulatory Bundle is submitted to be evaluated against a [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations). The synchronous request will provide error codes and instant feedback to fix the Regulatory Bundle.

# Bundles Resource

> \[!WARNING]
>
> The v2 Regulatory Compliance APIs are currently in Public Beta. No breaking changes in the API contract will occur when the API moves from Public Beta to GA.

The Twilio Bundles REST API allows you to create empty Regulatory Bundle containers. The Regulatory Bundles are [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) of [End-Users](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) and [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) for regulatory compliance.

Depending on the configuration of the bundle, the bundle is being assessed against a [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) (e.g., Germany local phone numbers for a business). Different [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) need [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) combinations of [End-User Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types) and [Supporting Document Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types).

## Bundles Response Properties

The field of the Bundle resource response is in JSON. The type SID\<BU> is a unique ID starting with letters BU. For more information about Twilio SIDs, please refer to [Twilio's glossary on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v2.regulatory_compliance.bundle","modelName":"numbers_v2_regulatory_compliance_bundle","properties":{"sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BU[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource."},"account_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^AC[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The SID of the [Account](/docs/iam/api/account) that created the Bundle resource."},"regulation_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^RN[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string of a regulation that is associated to the Bundle resource."},"friendly_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The string that you assigned to describe the resource."},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["draft","pending-review","in-review","twilio-rejected","twilio-approved","provisionally-approved"],"description":"The verification status of the Bundle resource.","refName":"bundle_enum_status","modelName":"bundle_enum_status"},"valid_until":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format when the resource will be valid until."},"email":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The email address that will receive updates when the Bundle resource changes status."},"status_callback":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The URL we call to inform your application of status changes."},"date_created":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT when the resource was created specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format."},"date_updated":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT when the resource was last updated specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format."},"url":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The absolute URL of the Bundle resource."},"links":{"type":"object","format":"uri-map","nullable":true,"description":"The URLs of the Assigned Items of the Bundle resource."}}}
```

### Bundle Statuses

The following statuses encompass the Bundle lifecycle.

| ***Status***      | ***Description***                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *draft*           | The user has created a new Bundle that can be edited with Supporting Documents and End-User objects assigned.                                                           |
| *pending-review*  | When the user has finished the draft of the Bundle and submits to Twilio for review, the status moves from `draft` to `pending-review`.                                 |
| *in-review*       | Twilio has moved the Bundle from `pending-review` to `in-review.` Once Twilio has finished review, the Bundle will go either to `twilio-approved` or `twilio-rejected`. |
| *twilio-rejected* | Twilio has reviewed the Bundle and has determined the Bundle does not meet the regulations.                                                                             |
| *twilio-approved* | Twilio has reviewed the Bundle and has determined the Bundles does meet the regulations.                                                                                |

### Status Callback

Every time the Bundle resource's `status` changes (except for when it changes from `pending-review` to `in_review`), Twilio sends a `POST` request to the URL specified in the Bundle's `statusCallback` property. The `Content-Type` of the request is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

| ***Field***   | ***Description***                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AccountSID    | The SID of the [Account](/docs/iam/api/account) that created the Bundle resource.                                      |
| BundleSID     | The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource.                                                     |
| Status        | The verification status of the Bundle resource. See [Bundle Statuses](#bundle-statuses) for a list of possible values. |
| FailureReason | The description(s) of what incorrect configuration the Regulatory Bundle currently has.                                |

## Create a Bundle

`POST https://numbers.twilio.com/v2/RegulatoryCompliance/Bundles`

To provision or port a [phone number](/docs/glossary/what-virtual-phone-number) to Twilio, you will need to create a new Bundle that will contain all the information required to follow local telco [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations).

The Bundle is a container that references the required Regulatory Compliance information set forth by the regulating telecom body of the end-user who actually answers the phone call or receives the message.

When creating the Bundle, you will specify the following parameters `IsoCountry`, `NumberType`, and `EndUserType` so you can follow compliance for a Regulation.

### Request body parameters

```json
{"schema":{"type":"object","title":"CreateBundleRequest","required":["FriendlyName","Email"],"properties":{"FriendlyName":{"type":"string","description":"The string that you assigned to describe the resource."},"Email":{"type":"string","description":"The email address that will receive updates when the Bundle resource changes status."},"StatusCallback":{"type":"string","format":"uri","description":"The URL we call to inform your application of status changes."},"RegulationSid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^RN[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","description":"The unique string of a regulation that is associated to the Bundle resource."},"IsoCountry":{"type":"string","description":"The [ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) of the Bundle's phone number country ownership request."},"EndUserType":{"type":"string","enum":["individual","business"],"refName":"bundle_enum_end_user_type","modelName":"bundle_enum_end_user_type"},"NumberType":{"type":"string","description":"The type of phone number of the Bundle's ownership request.

# Regulation Resource

## Regulations Response Properties

The Twilio Regulatory Compliance REST API allows you to view and understand Regulations. Regulations are requirements based on [End-Users](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) and [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) set for by each country's government.

A Regulation dictates the [Regulatory Bundles](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) composition of [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments).

> \[!CAUTION]
>
> Regulations can and do change. Please make sure not to hardcode any regulation within your application. The Regulation resource is for you to call and populate the values required for regulatory compliance.

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v2.regulatory_compliance.regulation","modelName":"numbers_v2_regulatory_compliance_regulation","properties":{"sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^RN[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that identifies the Regulation resource."},"friendly_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"A human-readable description that is assigned to describe the Regulation resource. Examples can include Germany: Mobile - Business."},"iso_country":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The ISO country code of the phone number's country."},"number_type":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The type of phone number restricted by the regulatory requirement. For example, Germany mobile phone numbers provisioned by businesses require a business name with commercial register proof from the Handelsregisterauszug and a proof of address from Handelsregisterauszug or a trade license by Gewerbeanmeldung."},"end_user_type":{"type":"string","enum":["individual","business"],"description":"The type of End User the regulation requires - can be `individual` or `business`.","refName":"regulation_enum_end_user_type","modelName":"regulation_enum_end_user_type"},"requirements":{"nullable":true,"description":"The SID of an object that holds the regulatory information of the phone number country, phone number type, and end user type."},"url":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The absolute URL of the Regulation resource."}}}
```

## Fetch a Regulation Instance

`GET https://numbers.twilio.com/v2/RegulatoryCompliance/Regulations/{Sid}`

A Regulation instance details the [End-User Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types) and values along with [Supporting Document Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types).

### Path parameters

## Retrieve a list of regulations

`GET https://numbers.twilio.com/v2/RegulatoryCompliance/Regulations`

The Regulations list is extensive and covers all Twilio's countries in the [Phone Number Regulations Guidelines](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory).

The Regulations `LIST` endpoint is filterable by `IsoCountry`, `NumberType`, and `EndUserType` so you can select the correct instance of the collection of regulatory requirements.

# Supporting Document Types Resource

> \[!WARNING]
>
> The v2 Regulatory Compliance APIs are currently in Public Beta. No breaking changes in the API contract will occur when the API moves from Public Beta to GA.

The Supporting Document Type resource of Twilio's Regulatory Compliance API informs you which type of document you create and what the values are. You will then create a new [Supporting Document](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) with the correct type and values.

Each [Supporting Document Type](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types) may need different information to be compliant. Supporting Documents [Assigned as Items](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) to a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) along with an [End-User](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) satisfy a [Regulation](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory).

## Supporting Document Types Response Properties

The field of the Supporting Document Types resource response is in JSON. The type SID\<OY> is a unique ID starting with letters OY. For more information about Twilio SIDs, please refer to [Twilio's glossary on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v2.regulatory_compliance.supporting_document_type","modelName":"numbers_v2_regulatory_compliance_supporting_document_type","properties":{"sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^OY[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that identifies the Supporting Document Type resource."},"friendly_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"A human-readable description of the Supporting Document Type resource."},"machine_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The machine-readable description of the Supporting Document Type resource."},"fields":{"type":"array","nullable":true,"description":"The required information for creating a Supporting Document. The required fields will change as regulatory needs change and will differ for businesses and individuals."},"url":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The absolute URL of the Supporting Document Type resource."}}}
```

# EndUsers resource

> \[!WARNING]
>
> Twilio released the Regulatory Compliance API v2 under Public Beta.

The end user represents an individual or business that must comply with [regulations][reg-rsrc]. This end user answers a phone call or receives a message from a phone number. To learn more about supported end user categories, see the [`EndUserType` resource][endusertype-rsrc].

To meet regulatory compliance, you must submit a [Regulatory Bundle][reg-bundle-rsrc] to the regulator. These bundles combine end users who use the phone number and [supporting documents][sup-docs-rsrc] that verify the end user, number, and, if needed, company.

After you create an empty Regulatory Bundle, you can [assign end users][item-assign-rsrc] created with this resource to that bundle.

## EndUsers response properties

The `EndUsers` resource returns a response in JSON format. To learn more about Twilio SIDs, see the [glossary entry on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

```json

```

## Create one end user instance

`POST https://numbers.twilio.com/v2/RegulatoryCompliance/EndUsers`

To provision or port a phone number to Twilio, create an end user for that phone number.

Each end user represents the individual or business who answers a phone call or receives a text message.

# End-User Types Resource

> \[!WARNING]
>
> The v2 Regulatory Compliance APIs are currently in Public Beta. No breaking changes in the API contract will occur when the API moves from Public Beta to GA.

The Twilio End-User Type resource of Twilio's Regulatory Compliance API informs you which type of end-user you can create and what the values are. Once you know which end-user type you want to create and the required values, you will create using the [End-User resource](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users). Each End-User Type has a different set of values required to be compliant.

You will [Assign Items](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) to an End-User of a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) with [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents). For applications that manage many End-Users, you will need to ensure that you assign the End-User instance to the correct Bundle instance to be in compliance with regulations.

## End-User Types Response Properties

The output JSON response details the types and values of the `End-User Type` resource. The type SID\<OY> is a unique ID starting with letters OY. For more information about Twilio SIDs, please refer to [Twilio's glossary on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

The field of the End-User Types resource response is in JSON. The type SID\<OY> is a unique ID starting with letters OY. For more information about Twilio SIDs, please refer to [Twilio's glossary on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v2.regulatory_compliance.end_user_type","modelName":"numbers_v2_regulatory_compliance_end_user_type","properties":{"sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^OY[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that identifies the End-User Type resource."},"friendly_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"A human-readable description that is assigned to describe the End-User Type resource. Examples can include first name, last name, email, business name, etc"},"machine_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"A machine-readable description of the End-User Type resource.

# Item Assignments Resource

> \[!WARNING]
>
> The v2 Regulatory Compliance APIs are currently in Public Beta. No breaking changes in the API contract will occur when the API moves from Public Beta to GA.

The Twilio Item Assignments REST API allows you to assign [End-Users](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) and [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) to [Regulatory Bundles](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles).

The configuration of the Regulatory Bundle must pass a [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) (e.g., *Germany* *local* phone numbers for a *business*). Different [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) need [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) combinations of [End-User Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types) and [Supporting Document Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types).

With the correct items assigned to the [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles), you can *submit* the bundle by changing its status. After submission, the Twilio regulatory reviewers will review the Regulatory Bundle.

## Item Assignments Response Properties

All the fields returned in the output JSON response compose what an Item Assignment is. The type SID\<BV> is a unique ID of an Item Assignment and starts with letters BV. For more information about Twilio SIDs, please refer to [Twilio's glossary on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v2.regulatory_compliance.bundle.item_assignment","modelName":"numbers_v2_regulatory_compliance_bundle_item_assignment","properties":{"sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BV[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Item Assignment resource."},"bundle_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BU[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource."},"account_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^AC[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The SID of the [Account](/docs/iam/api/account) that created the Item Assignment resource."},"object_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^[a-zA-Z]{2}[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The SID of an object bag that holds information of the different items."},"date_created":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT when the resource was created specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format."},"url":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The absolute URL of the Identity resource."}}}
```

## Assign Items to a Regulatory Bundle

`POST https://numbers.twilio.com/v2/RegulatoryCompliance/Bundles/{BundleSid}/ItemAssignments`

To provision or port a phone number on or to Twilio, you will need to assign an [End-User](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-users) to a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles). The [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) may need one or more [Supporting Documents](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-documents) assignments to a Regulatory Bundle. The Supporting Documents may need an image uploaded as *proof*.

The Item Assignments to a Regulatory Bundle associate a container with other objects that follows a Regulation.

The Regulations are unique by the phone number's country, type, and end-user type.

### Path parameters

```json
[{"name":"BundleSid","in":"path","description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource.","schema":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BU[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$"},"required":true}]
```

### Request body parameters

# Evaluations Resource

> \[!WARNING]
>
> The v2 Regulatory Compliance APIs are currently in Public Beta. No breaking changes in the API contract will occur when the API moves from Public Beta to GA.

The Twilio Evaluations REST API allows you to create new evaluation instances and also providing a list of historical instances for review.

Depending on the configuration of the Regulatory Bundle, the [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) is being assessed against a [Regulation](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) (e.g., Germany local phone numbers for a business). Different [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) need specific [Item Assignments](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/item-assignments) combinations of [End-User Types](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/end-user-types) and [Supporting Document Types with](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/supporting-document-types) [Addresses](/docs/usage/api/address). Once these Item Assignments have configured the Regulatory Bundle to be containing the correct configuration, Regulatory Bundles can be submitted to Twilio and synchronously evaluated for granular failure reasons.

## Evaluations Response Properties

### Evaluation Statuses

| ***Status***   | ***Description***                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *noncompliant* | The evaluation with context of a Regulation has determined the Regulatory Bundle is non-compliant. Failure reasons have been provided in the response to help debugging.         |
| *compliant*    | The evaluation with context of a Regulation has determined the Regulatory Bundle as compliant. The Regulatory Bundle can now be used for assignment with eligible phone numbers. |

## Create a new Evaluation

`POST https://numbers.twilio.com/v2/RegulatoryCompliance/Bundles/{BundleSid}/Evaluations`

At any point of a Regulatory Bundle's lifecycle, a Regulatory Bundle can be evaluated. Once a new evaluation of a Bundle has been created, the instance will be persisted in the Bundle's list of evaluations.

Title: Bundle Copies Resource
Source: md

============================================================================================

# Bundle Copies Resource

> \[!NOTE]
>
> This page is specifically about the Replace Items subresource of a Bundle. Please refer to [Regulatory Compliance REST APIs](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api) for general knowledge or [FAQ](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq) page.

With the new Bundle Copy resource, developers can now update their compliance information when Regulations change while they continue their Phone Number provisioning habits before the compliance information is no longer valid. The resource copies a Regulatory Bundle to allow updating of the compliance information in a mutable state.

## Copies Response Properties

The field of the Bundle resource response is in JSON. The type SID\<BU> is a unique ID starting with letters BU. For more information about Twilio SIDs, please refer to [Twilio's glossary on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v2.regulatory_compliance.bundle.bundle_copy","modelName":"numbers_v2_regulatory_compliance_bundle_bundle_copy","properties":{"sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BU[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource."},"account_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^AC[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The SID of the [Account](/docs/iam/api/account) that created the Bundle resource."},"regulation_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^RN[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string of a regulation that is associated to the Bundle resource."},"friendly_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The string that you assigned to describe the resource."},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["draft","pending-review","in-review","twilio-rejected","twilio-approved","provisionally-approved"],"description":"The verification status of the Bundle resource.","refName":"bundle_copy_enum_status","modelName":"bundle_copy_enum_status"},"valid_until":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format when the resource will be valid until."},"email":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The email address that will receive updates when the Bundle resource changes status."},"status_callback":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The URL we call to inform your application of status changes."},"date_created":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT when the resource was created specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format."},"date_updated":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT when the resource was last updated specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format."}}}
```

### Bundle Statuses

The following statuses encompass the Bundle lifecycle.

| ***Status***      | ***Description***                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *draft*           | The user has created a new Bundle that can be edited with Supporting Documents and End-User objects assigned.                                                       |
| *pending-review*  | When the user has finished the draft of the Bundle and submits to Twilio for `review`, the status moves from draft to `pending-review`.                             |
| *in-review*       | Twilio has moved the Bundle from pending-review to in-review. Once Twilio has finished review, the Bundle will go either to `twilio-approved` or `twilio-rejected`. |
| *twilio-rejected* | Twilio has reviewed the Bundle and has determined the Bundle does not meet the regulations.                                                                         |
| *twilio-approved* | Twilio has reviewed the Bundle and has determined the Bundles does meet the regulations.                                                                            |

Title: Bundle Replace Items Resource

============================================================================================

# Bundle Replace Items Resource

> \[!NOTE]
>
> This page is specifically about the Replace Items subresource of a Bundle. Please refer to [Regulatory Compliance REST APIs](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api) for general knowledge or [FAQ](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/faq) page.

With the new Replace Items resource, developers can now update their compliance information when Regulations change while continuing to provision new Phone Numbers before their compliance information is no longer valid. The Replace Items resource replaces a `twilio-approved` Regulatory Bundle's Items with a `twilio-approved` Bundle Copy. By replacing the old items with the newly approved Bundle Copy Items Assigned, you will not have to worry about reassigning any Phone Numbers or other potential dependencies that rely on the Bundle.

## Replace Items Response properties

The field of the Bundle resource response is in JSON. The type SID\<BU> is a unique ID starting with letters BU. For more information about Twilio SIDs, please refer to [Twilio's glossary on SIDs](/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid).

```json
{"type":"object","refName":"numbers.v2.regulatory_compliance.bundle.replace_items","modelName":"numbers_v2_regulatory_compliance_bundle_replace_items","properties":{"sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^BU[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string that we created to identify the Bundle resource."},"account_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^AC[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The SID of the [Account](/docs/iam/api/account) that created the Bundle resource."},"regulation_sid":{"type":"string","minLength":34,"maxLength":34,"pattern":"^RN[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$","nullable":true,"description":"The unique string of a regulation that is associated to the Bundle resource."},"friendly_name":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The string that you assigned to describe the resource."},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["draft","pending-review","in-review","twilio-rejected","twilio-approved","provisionally-approved"],"description":"The verification status of the Bundle resource.","refName":"replace_items_enum_status","modelName":"replace_items_enum_status"},"valid_until":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format when the resource will be valid until."},"email":{"type":"string","nullable":true,"description":"The email address that will receive updates when the Bundle resource changes status."},"status_callback":{"type":"string","format":"uri","nullable":true,"description":"The URL we call to inform your application of status changes."},"date_created":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT when the resource was created specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format."},"date_updated":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","nullable":true,"description":"The date and time in GMT when the resource was last updated specified in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format."}}}

### Bundle Statuses

The following statuses encompass the Bundle lifecycle.

| ***Status***      | ***Description***                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *draft*           | The user has created a new Bundle that can be edited with Supporting Documents and End-User objects assigned.                                                           |
| *pending-review*  | When the user has finished the draft of the Bundle and submits to Twilio for review, the status moves from `draft` to `pending-review`.                                 |
| *in-review*       | Twilio has moved the Bundle from `pending-review` to `in-review`. Once Twilio has finished review, the Bundle will go either to `twilio-approved` or `twilio-rejected`. |
| *twilio-rejected* | Twilio has reviewed the Bundle and has determined the Bundle does not meet the regulations.                                                                             |
| *twilio-approved* | Twilio has reviewed the Bundle and has determined the Bundles does meet the regulations.                                                                                |

# Phone Number Regulatory FAQ

To use phone numbers compliantly in many countries of the world, both Twilio and our customers must adhere to the local country regulations. Doing so often means that we must provide adequate identity documentation to the local regulator or carrier. If they don't provide this information, there is a high risk the local regulators or carriers will disconnect the phone number.

This list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) will provide more details about regulations, what you need to do to stay compliant, and why.

## **General Phone Number Regulatory FAQ**

### **Q: How are phone number regulations changing and why?**

A: Many countries around the world have recently been increasing their scrutiny of how their phone numbers are used. This increased scrutiny is driven by various factors, including increased incidents of misuse and abuse of phone numbers, heightened national security concerns, and increased pressure on the supply of numbers.

As a result, various countries are updating their regulations or placing greater emphasis on the enforcement of existing regulations, including those requiring validation of who is actually using the phone number and exactly where that individual or business is located. In short, the intent of these regulations is to verify who is using the number and where they are.

Twilio, our customers, end users, and providers each have a role and a collective obligation to ensure numbers are assigned and used in a manner consistent with the intent of the regulations in the relevant country.

### **Q: Is this enforcement only impacting Twilio customers? Is it because there's spam and abuse on your platform?**

A: No. Twilio does not permit spam or abuse on our platform. Regulatory requirements are due to worldwide enforcement of existing and new regulations as nations seek to have better control over their national communications infrastructures. All communications companies, including Twilio, are subject to these regulations, and providers and end customers ignore such requirements at their peril. End-user phone numbers that do not comply are at risk of being disconnected due to national regulatory action without notice regardless of provider, a gamble to which Twilio does not subject its customers or itself.

### **Q: Other providers do not require address and identity information for my phone numbers. Why does Twilio?**

A: Many countries around the world have recently been increasing their scrutiny of how their phone numbers are used. We strongly believe all providers are being asked—or soon will be asked—to provide the same information Twilio requires. In every country, the regulations apply equally to all phone number providers. Twilio is in no way being singled out.

### **Q: Which countries are affected? What are the exact requirements?**

A: To help you comply with these regulations and minimize the risk of disruption to your phone numbers, Twilio maintains an up-to-date country-by-country guide of [phone number regulatory requirements](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory). We urge our customers to provide the necessary information for each country to help ensure their service isn't interrupted or disconnected.

To understand these regulations, it's helpful to keep in mind the objective: Regulators want to know who is using the phone number and where they are located. It is therefore understandable that the regulations focus on the end user, the party actually using the phone number in question to make or receive calls. It also makes sense that regulators want the end user's name, address, proof of address, and/or an identity document, and that all the documents must match. For example, the name on a utility bill submitted as proof of address must exactly match the name on the submitted passport. In some instances, a local address is required, as indicated by country.

### **Q: I've been told to "map" my phone numbers to addresses and identity documents. What does this mean, and how do I do it?**

A: Phone numbers with regulatory requirements need to have certain information or documents associated with them, which is what we call "mapping". It lets us know which phone numbers go with which addresses and identity documents. You can find instructions on how to map a phone number to an address and document [here](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/console-create-new-bundle).

### **Q: Is there a limit on how old supporting documentation can be?**

A: Yes, we require the date of any business registration to be in line with country requirements. If there is a country requirement that a piece of documentation be valid within a certain timeframe, it will be listed on the country requirement page. If there is no country requirement, we prefer documentation used to confirm an address and is not a government ID — such as utility bills, rent receipts, etc. — to be dated within three months of submission. We prefer other documentation to be dated within one year of submission, so we have the most up-to-date information for your company on file. Please check your country registry to obtain the most up-to-date documentation available to you.

### **Q: Can I reuse documents I've uploaded in the Console for previous Regulatory Bundles or do I need to upload them again?**

A: Yes, you can utilize identity and supporting documentation that you've already uploaded to create a new Regulatory Bundle. While creating a Regulatory Bundle, look for the option to **Select existing individual/business information**. Eligible options will be presented in a table: choose the desired option and click **Select & Save**. The same is true for the supporting documentation. When adding supporting documentation, you can click the **Select existing supporting document** option, and choose the desired document from the table. Only documents that meet the regulatory requirements will be presented.

If your supporting documentation is older than one year, new documentation will need to be uploaded.

### **Q: Can I use a P.O. Box or Virtual Address as my proof of local address?**

A: No, we are not able to accept a document with a P.O. Box or Virtual Address as a proof of a local address.

### **Q: Can I delete Regulatory Bundles?**

A: You can delete Regulatory Bundles in **Draft** state. Deleting a draft Regulatory Bundle will unassign any Supporting Documents and End-Users you have assigned to the draft Regulatory Bundle, but these objects will not be deleted.

### **Q: Can I delete Supporting Documents?**

A: Yes, you can delete Supporting Documents in **Draft** and **Rejected** states. You will not be able to delete a Supporting Document that is assigned to a Regulatory Bundle. When deleting a Supporting Document, note that Twilio retains data associated with the Supporting Document for legal, anti-fraud, or security purposes in accordance with applicable law. For more information, please visit our [Terms of Service](/en-us/legal/privacy#what-customer-account-data-twilio-processes-when-you-sign-up-for-and-log-into-a-twilio-account-and-why) and [Privacy Policy](/en-us/legal/privacy#how-long-we-store-your-customer-account-data) sections.

### **Q: Can I delete End-Users?**

Yes, you can delete End-Users that are not assigned to Regulatory Bundles. When you delete an End-User, you should note that Twilio retains data associated with the End-User for legal, anti-fraud, or security purposes in accordance with applicable law. For more information, please visit our [Terms of Service](/en-us/legal/privacy#what-customer-account-data-twilio-processes-when-you-sign-up-for-and-log-into-a-twilio-account-and-why) and [Privacy Policy](/en-us/legal/privacy#how-long-we-store-your-customer-account-data) sections.

### **Q: How long does it take Twilio to verify documents that have been submitted?**

A: We do our best to verify documents submitted within 24 business hours.

### **Q: What is Twilio doing to make regulatory compliance easier for me?**

A: We are investing heavily in automated systems to make compliance easier. We have brought a number of these systems online already and you'll see many improvements in the coming months that will make the process easier and faster. These systems will include intelligently determining and presenting regulatory requirements for each number-set up front, a new user experience, and improved APIs to help guide you through the processes required.

### **Q: How is Twilio handling privacy?**

A: Twilio takes privacy very seriously. Twilio must collect the data requested and we have legitimate interests for doing so, including regulatory obligations and fraud and abuse prevention. Accordingly, the collection of this data is lawful under privacy law. Although we must collect the data, we remain conscious that the data being collected is sensitive and we must treat it accordingly. The data is subject to the requirements of our [Binding Corporate Rules - Controller Policy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/bcr/controller), which provides for application of a GDPR-level of data protection regardless of where the data originates globally. And pursuant to our internal data protection risk impact assessment, the data is subject to more stringent handling requirements commensurate to the sensitivity level. Among other things, these requirements include limiting access to the data to only those staff members who must see it to perform their job functions, conducting privacy and security training with these staff members prior to permitting them to handle the data, and ensuring all data is stored securely.

### **Q: Where can I find the regulations underpinning Twilio's requirements page?**

A: Our requirements are a synthesis of multiple sources and therefore generally cannot be found verbatim in the local regulations. The sources we use are primarily the text of the regulations, direct conversations with regulators, the judgment and interpretation of Twilio's legal counsel, industry best practices, the standards of telephone carriers, and our experience in handling requests by government and law enforcement agencies.

### **Q: I need to retain my phone number in a country but do not meet the requirements. What should I do?**

A: If you cannot meet the requirements for a specific phone number type in a given country, we recommend you look at a different number type for that country. Countries often have multiple phone number types (for example, national vs. local), and different phone number types are set up for different uses and have different requirements. It may be that you are using a current phone number type that isn't appropriate for your situation; for example, local numbers are often meant for people with physical addresses in a specific region of a country. However, there is often another number type in the same country that is well suited to your situation. If that approach doesn't work, then you may have to use a phone number in another country where you meet the requirements. Please email your account rep or contact Twilio Support through the [Console](https://console.twilio.com/) or [Help Center](https://help.twilio.com) for assistance, if you cannot find a solution.

### **Q: I need to retain my current phone numbers in a country where I don't meet the regulatory requirements for any of the phone number types. I've tried everything you've outlined and there is no acceptable alternative. What do I do? What is Twilio doing to help me?**

A: We recognize that this is an exceedingly difficult situation for our customers. We want to assure you that we'll allow you to use your current phone numbers for as long as we reasonably can. We will only disconnect your phone numbers if there is no other legal option available.

We are also committed to helping you find a solution in the following ways:

* We are actively working to enable new number types in some countries.
* As the opportunities arise, we will advocate for changes to these regulations. We fundamentally believe that every country should offer a phone number type accessible to any international business that provides valuable services to the citizens of that country. We are, however, realistic about timelines. We recognize that the passage of new regulations may take time, and as a result, this approach is likely a longer-term solution.
* We are working on possible solutions that would make it easier for customers to comply with current regulations. For example, there are sometimes relatively inexpensive ways for you to set up a legal entity and/or a presence in a country. We are investigating where we can provide lightweight solutions to meet the requirements.

### **Q: Can I automate the Regulatory Compliance workflow for my company or my customers?**

A: Yes, by utilizing the [v2 Regulatory Compliance APIs](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/create-new-bundle-public-rest-apis), you can build your own web portal for your customers to self-service manage their Regulatory Compliance.

### **Q: Our legal/authorized representative does not wish to provide a copy of their ID, which is required for the phone number type I am trying to provision. What options do I have?**

A: Your options vary by country. The first thing you should do is reference Twilio's [Regulatory Guidelines](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory) to determine whether an alternative exists. For example, in France, if you do not wish to provide a copy of the proof of identity of the authorized representative of your company, you can execute a Power of Attorney signed by the authorized representative, and submit the identity of the individual who is identified on the Power of Attorney.

If you review the Regulatory Guidelines and still have questions about identity documents, you can contact your account representative, or reach out to Twilio Support through the [Console](https://console.twilio.com/) or [Help Center](https://help.twilio.com/hc/en-us/) for additional information.

### **Q: Can I set up a trial account with trial phone numbers that require regulatory information/documents even though I cannot provide any regulatory documentation?**

A: No, you cannot. Regulators and carriers expect phone numbers to be compliant from the time they begin to be in use. However, you should be able to select a phone number type in a country where you can meet the necessary regulatory requirements. If you are unable to determine what type of number this may be, you should contact your account representative or reach out to Twilio Support through the [Console](https://console.twilio.com/) or [Help Center](https://help.twilio.com/hc/en-us/) for additional information.

## **Privacy and Safety FAQ**

### **Q: What does Twilio do with my or my customer's sensitive personal data like a passport?**

A: Twilio takes its responsibility to safeguard your sensitive personal data very seriously. Accordingly, Twilio applies technical controls such as encryption, access logging and least privileged access when processing this data. In addition to technical controls, our staff undergoes training on the proper handling of this data. Twilio is committed to applying the highest standards of protection for personal data and accordingly has implemented [Binding Corporate Rules](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/binding-corporate-rules). In addition, Twilio is [ISO 27001](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/security#certifications) certified.

### **Q: What support is provided around enabling emergency services in different countries?**

A: We recognize that certain phone number use cases in certain countries will require emergency services support for the provisioned phone numbers. Please contact Twilio Support through the [Console](https://console.twilio.com/) or [Help Center](https://help.twilio.com/hc/en-us/) for help prior to purchase if you need more information.

## **Phone Number Use Case FAQ**

### **Q: How do I determine the right phone number type for my use case?**

A: You should start by identifying the country where you want to provision the phone number. Then, you should review that country's [Regulatory Compliance](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory) requirements and determine what numbers you are eligible to provision, based on your location and the documentation you have available to you. You can also review the [SMS and Voice guidelines](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines), which have additional information about usage. Additionally, you can contact your assigned account representative, who may be able to further assist you. Finally, you can take a short [training](https://www.twiliotraining.com/store/585648-international-phone-number-regulations#description) we developed to learn more about international regulatory compliance.

### **Q: Is there anything about how phone numbers are used in the country I want to provision a number that I need to know?**

A: Yes. Every country treats phone numbers differently, and in some cases a country has restrictions around how certain number types can be used. You can view country-specific considerations [here](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines), but this list may not be comprehensive. We strongly encourage our customers to review proposed use cases with qualified legal counsel to make sure that they comply with applicable laws. The following are some general best practices for SMS messaging, but you should seek counsel regarding your specific use case:

1. Get opt-in consent from each end user before sending any communication to them, in particular for marketing or other non-essential communications.
2. Only communicate during an end user's daytime hours unless it is urgent.
3. SMS campaigns should support HELP/STOP messages, and similar messages, in the end user's local language.
4. Do not contact end users on do-not-call or do-not-disturb registries.

## **Prefix Locality Matching FAQ**

### **Q: Why do I have to assign an address that matches the phone number's prefix locality?**

A: In some countries, regulators require that local and/or national numbers be affiliated with an address associated within the locality of the phone number's prefix. This goes back to the early days of telephony, when phone numbers were assigned specifically to an individual's home or business, and would change if the home or business location moved. While this is not the way that phone numbers typically work these days, we nonetheless must respect each jurisdiction's right to protect their local number blocks, and comply with these regulations.

## **Phone Numbers Console Regulatory FAQ**

### **Q: How do I use the Compliance Report in Console to determine which numbers are out of compliance?**

A: The Phone Numbers Regulatory Compliance Report displays all your regulated phone numbers, the overall compliance status, and a quick link to individually map each phone number.

Find the Compliance Report section under Regulatory Compliance in the Twilio Console. To start, use the provided filter to find the country and phone number type of interest to you. When you have made the desired selection, please click the Search button. You will see a list of Phone Numbers with their current compliance status: *Compliant*, *Not Compliant*, and *Pending Review: Provisionally Approved*.

For each number in this list, you can review the current compliance status and when needed, ***Map to Regulatory Bundle and Address*** following the provided link under the verification column.

You can learn more in the [Console: Regulatory Compliance Report Getting Started](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/console-regulatory-compliance-report).

## **Regulatory Compliance Communications FAQ**

### **Q: Why are you emailing me again about regulatory compliance?**

A: In most cases, for one of two reasons:

1. There are phone numbers in your account that do not have appropriate identity information mapped to them.
2. We have received notification from a regulator or carrier of new regulatory requirements, and need to collect additional information from you.

Currently, the bulk of our regulatory compliance emails relate to 1. These are not new requirements, indeed, we have been informing our customers of these requirements for more than a year. To avoid receiving these emails from us going forward, please verify that *all* numbers in [countries with regulatory requirements posted](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/regulatory) have valid identity information mapped to them, and have been marked as "compliant". You can check the status of your numbers by accessing your [Compliance Report](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/compliance-report).

In the event of new regulatory or carrier requirements (2), we strive to give you the tools necessary to comply. To that end, you should expect that all communications from us regarding changes to regulations will clearly state:

1. What phone numbers are at-risk.
2. What the change requires.
3. How to provide the necessary information.
4. A clear deadline to come to compliance.

In some instances, you may also receive outreach from our Customer Support team and/or your account representative in order to further assist you in bringing your numbers into compliance.

### **Q: I received an email regarding compliance. Can you let me know what phone number and what document(s) I am missing?**

A: Yes. We are here to help. To determine which of your numbers is out of compliance, you can check your [Compliance Report](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/compliance-report). You can also reach out to your account representative for additional assistance, or contact Twilio Support through the [Console](https://console.twilio.com/) or [Help Center](https://help.twilio.com/hc/en-us/) if you continue to have trouble.

## **V2 RC Platform FAQ**

### **Q: What do the v2 RC APIs provide in functionality?**

A: The v2 RC APIs provide the following new functionality:

* Request Regulations requirements via API for a given country, phone number type, and end-user type.
* Manage a library of uploaded End-User information, Supporting Documents, and Regulatory Bundles.
* Granular error handling of Regulations.
* Final API contract for Regulatory Compliance management (contract will not change moving forward).

### **Q: When will the new v2 RC APIs be available?**

A: The new v2 RC APIs are currently available for public use. For more information visit this [Table of Contents for API docs](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api).

Q: What are the different RC objects?

A:

***Regulation:*** Bundle Requirements are the specific prerequisites to create a Bundle. These can be different depending on the context. For Regulatory Bundles, the **Requirement** is the Regulation, designated by the Regulation SID.

***Regulatory Bundle:*** A Regulatory Bundle is a container that groups the assignment of End-User, Use-Case Restrictions, Addresses, and Supporting Documents. The collection of these Item Assignments are used to pass a Regulatory Compliance regulation for number

***End-User:*** A collection of metadata representing the entity who will be communicating using one of our products.

***Supporting Document:*** A collection of metadata representing a document to support an End-User's information, address, or use-case.

***Address:*** A locality-based object that represents the location of an End-User.

### **Q: What are the different statuses?**

A:

#### **Regulatory Bundle**

* `Draft`
* `Pending Review`
* `In Review`
* `Twilio Approved`
* `Twilio Rejected`

#### **Supporting Document**

* `Draft`
* `Pending Review`
* `Approved`
* `Expired`
* `Rejected`

### **Q: What is the workflow for a Regulatory Bundle?**

A: You can view the workflow below or in the [v2 RC APIs Getting Started page](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/create-new-bundle-public-rest-apis).

![Workflow showing stages from draft to third party accepted or rejected.](https://docs-resources.prod.twilio.com/c642d80494d4498def49e0069b511b7f19cb9b4538f61af663d23c9b4ff7953f.png)

### **Q: How does this impact me if I don't use the API but instead use Console?**

A: The Twilio Console experience also changed in December 2019 to help you get your numbers to compliance much easier. You will begin this process in the Phone Numbers > Regulatory Compliance section, where you will Create a Regulatory Bundle. Here you will define the country and phone number type you are getting ready to provision, and then follow each step in the creation process providing the required information and documentation. Before completing the Bundle creation process, each ISO country and number type requires different information and/or documents based on specific country regulations.

Once your Bundle has been created and verified, you can now provision phone numbers for the specific country and number type you created the Bundle for. Head to the Buy a Number section and follow the on-screen steps to map the new phone number to your Bundle.

### **Q: What is a Bundle SID?**

A: A BundleSID is an object that acts as a container to store metadata and to reference other objects that comply with a regulation. When a Bundle has been evaluated against a regulation and passed, the BundleSID can then be assigned to a phone number.

### **Q: What is the difference between Bundle SIDs and Identity SIDs?**

A: IdentitySIDs are from v1.0 and v1.5 Regulatory Compliance. Identity objects are simplistic to the old Regulatory Compliance platform and do not have the robust information architecture as the current v2.0 Regulatory Compliance platform. Any migrated IdentitySIDs have a reference to the newBundle SID and both are accepted during provisioning.

### **Q: Do I need a Bundle SID for each phone number type in every country where I have phone numbers? In some countries the requirements are the same for each bundle type, so do I need a Bundle SID for each phone number type or can I use the same Bundle SID?**

A: Yes, a Regulatory Bundle is required for every single regulation. To decrease the complexity, Supporting Documents and End-Users can be re-used for multiple Bundles.

### **Q: Can I assign passed Regulatory Bundles to phone numbers in bulk?**

A: No, you can not currently assign phone numbers in bulk to Regulatory Bundles. For high number assignment, it's best to use the `/IncomingPhoneNumbers` API.

### **Q: Can I assign Supporting Documents across accounts?**

A: No, Supporting Documents are account specific and cannot be shared across multiple accounts.

### **Q: Can I assign End-Users across multiple accounts?**

A: No, End-Users cannot be shared across multiple accounts.

### **Q: My Regulatory Bundle has been in "pending review" longer than 72 hours, what can I do?**

A: We strive to review all regulatory bundles within a 72-hour timeframe. In the event that your regulatory bundle is not reviewed within 72-hours, please contact Twilio Support through the [Console](https://console.twilio.com/) or [Help Center](https://help.twilio.com/hc/en-us/) and one of our support agents will assist you in getting your bundle reviewed.

## **Update Compliance Information FAQ**

### **Q: Why do my Regulatory Bundles have a valid\_until date despite being approved?**

Twilio is required to enforce every countries' communication compliance requirements to ensure the trust of Twilio's network inhibits any traffic to/from Twilio's network. In cases where you may need to update your compliance information due to newly enacted laws/carrier mandates, Twilio will need to update the [Regulations](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) resource to reflect the new expression of regulatory requirements.

### **Q: How will I know when there is a Regulation update?**

There are **three** ways Twilio will communicate with customers when a Regulation update has occurred. Only the email alias

1. Opt to manually poll the [Regulations Public API](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) and report any differences
2. Opt-in to a service that informs you when Twilio's Regulatory Compliance Changelog page updates (e.g., [Wachete](https://www.wachete.com/))
3. Opt-in to receive a request to webhook that is assigned to a [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles) with a Regulation update that has been recently updated

Receive an email from the assigned alias of the [Regulatory Bundle](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/bundles)(s) with a Regulation update that has been recently updated

### **Q: How do I know a Regulatory Bundle needs to be updated?**

A new *valid\_until* field as of [March 10th, 2021](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/changelog/update-regulatory-bundles-when-action-is-required-using-console-or-public-api), displays the date when an *approved* Regulatory Bundle may still be used for new Phone Number provisioning. Once the *valid\_until* date expires, the Regulatory Bundle will move from *approved* to *rejected*. The Public API can filter the Regulatory Bundles List API by sending REQUEST while Console has a helpful filter located at the top of the page.

**Q: How do I update my compliance information?**

There are two getting started tutorials you can reference that will help you get started with both the [Public API](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/api-getting-started-compliance-information-update) and the [Console](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/console-getting-started-compliance-information-update) to update your compliance information of your Regulatory Bundles.

### **Q: When do I have to update my compliance information?**

Regulatory Bundle updates must be completed by the *`valid\_until`* date specified both in the status details column of the list page and the expiration date of the instance page.

### **Q: What happens if I don't update my compliance information?**

If you do not update your affected compliance information and the valid until date expires, the status of the Regulatory Bundle containing the out-of-date compliance information will move to a *rejected* state. Phone Numbers assigned to non-compliant information will be at risk of regulatory reclamation according to [Twilio's Phone Numbers Terms of Conditions](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/service-country-specific-terms/phone-numbers).

### **Q: Can I still provision new Phone Numbers while my Regulatory Bundle has an *`valid_until`* date set?**

Yes, until the *`valid_until`* date expires, the Regulatory Bundle will be eligible for continued Phone Number provisioning.

### **Q: Which Regulatory Bundle statuses will be eligible for provisioning while I update my compliance information?**

Only Bundles that were previously approved are eligible to provision new Phone Numbers while updating compliance information. Any Regulatory Bundles that are in other statuses will be moved to the *`twilio-rejected`* status.

### **Q: How long will the `valid\_until` date be set?**

The *`valid\_until`* date is up to the discretion of the country's/carrier regulator or Twilio. There is no one standardized time as each Regulation update has its own nuance. Always reference the Bundle instance's *`valid\_until`* date parameter when prioritizing updates.

### **Q: How will I know what I need to do?**

After filtering the Console list page for all of the Regulatory bundles that require an update, click on a record to redirect to the instance page. Once within the Regulatory Bundle Instance page, an Evaluation displays what is missing/wrong from the current set of compliance information. Look for all the information missing notifications.

### **Q: What is the difference between Console and Public API?**

If a user initiates the update through Twilio's Console, Twilio will go through the steps of copying and lifecycle transition on behalf of the customer. If the user is a developer leveraging the Public APIs, it is the responsibility of the developer to create a Regulatory Bundle Copy, Transfer Item Assignments, and then `DELETE` the Regulatory Bundle Copy. For more information, please refer to the [Public API Update Compliance Information Getting Started](/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started/api-getting-started-compliance-information-update).

## **IncomingPhoneNumbers API FAQ**

### **Q: Why have there been multiple changes to the IncomingPhoneNumbers provisioning API?**

A: The IncomingPhoneNumbers provisioning API was changed in September 2019 to make the Address parameter mandatory. Additionally, the API will be changed in February to require BundleSID. These changes are due to the increasing importance of regulatory compliance for phone numbers across the world. Many countries have recently been increasing their scrutiny of how their phone numbers are used. This increased scrutiny is driven by various factors, including increased incidents of misuse and abuse of phone numbers, heightened national security concerns, and increased pressure on the supply of numbers. As a result, various countries are updating their regulations or placing greater emphasis on the enforcement of existing regulations, including those requiring validation of who is actually using the phone number and exactly where that individual or business is located. Essentially the purpose of these regulations is to verify who is using the number and where they are. Twilio, our customers, end-users, and providers each have a role and a collective obligation to ensure numbers are assigned and used in a manner consistent with the intent of the regulations in the relevant country.

We decided to make these changes with our customers' best interests at heart as we monitor the regulatory compliance landscape. Twilio, our customers, end-users, and providers each have a role and a collective obligation to ensure numbers are assigned and used in a manner consistent with the intent of the regulations in the relevant country. Our goal is to avoid any of our customers being in jeopardy of losing a phone number due to noncompliance with phone number regulations. We understand that this change may be inconvenient and frustrating. Our goal is to protect your phone numbers within days of provisioning them by collecting the necessary information upfront through the API instead of asking our customers to react in a short time frame when a number is out of compliance.

### **Q: Will there be any more changes to the IncomingPhoneNumbers provisioning API?**

A: Yes, there are more changes that will be coming. One change will be every phone number that currently only requires a name and address will also require a Bundle with an Address assigned to a Supporting Document.
